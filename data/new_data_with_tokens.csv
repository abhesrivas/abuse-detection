p013r,"My friend recently told me she was abused as a child.  What should I do? Since school began last September, I noticed my friend hasn't been herself.  There were a few other things that she had done that weren't like her that my friends had told me about, and that really added to the fact that she was being very different.  Recently I confronted her on it and she told me she couldn't tell me in person so we messaged over facebook.

A few months ago a friend of hers committed suicide, and that contributed to it, but she also said that something else was bugging her.  She came out and told me that as a child she had been molested by her aunt's husband.  From when she was 3 until 8 years old, he would  touch her and I am the only person she has ever told.  I've known her since we were five, and when we were about 10 she wanted to tell me, but decided against it.  The uncle and aunt recently got divorced so I don't think she sees him any more.  She was reminded of it because her cousin turned 3 this past September.  She said she got over it, but it's obviously come back and it will continue to affect her.

What should I do?  It's been about a month since I talked to her about it.  The abuse isn't still happening so it's not like it will stop it, but this man could easily do it to another little girl, such as her cousin.  I want to help my friend and talk to her about it again, but I don't know what to say.  I don't know his name so I can't report it, and she made me promise not to tell her parents.  If I need to though, I will, but she said her dad would find and kill the man (I don't doubt it either).

This year though it's different.

You know how if you were adopted or something every time someone mentioned how wonderful their family was growing up it would be like a prick on your heart? That's how I feel this year about this holiday.

I am and have been going through a rough break (not breakup) with someone and every time I see something about this damn holiday it reminds me of it.

2xtfkn,"Weird dream about the end...and I caused it? I had a weird dream a couple nights ago and this was one was more clear than a lot I've had before. Basically, it was kind of like the movie, ""The Box"". A random stranger came up to me and gave me this device. The stranger said that if I push the device, the world will end, but would be back after one year if I didn't decide to press it in order to collect the device, and then just disappeared. I laughed about it and was about to throw it out before a crazy thought came to my head. What if it was true? Wouldn't that make me all powerful? I decided to have some fun and do a social experiment. I've been super happy a lot of times, but I've never been in love. I posted on all the major social media sites about the device I had, and that if any girl could show me what it felt like to be in love within a year, I wouldn't destroy the world. This was pretty much a huge joke. Even though it was a joke, no one contacted me. At first I didn't make a big deal of it, but slowly I began to become more cynical. Was no one at least curious about the situation and wanted to talk to me about it? A year passed by, and I was sitting on a park bench, when the random stranger appeared. He asked me if I made my decision. I just sat there and thought about it. Could I look seven billion plus people in the face and say, ""I'm sorry, but you died because of me""? Who was I to judge anyone? I ended up pressing the button and handing it back to him, thinking this was somehow a test of my character. All of a sudden everything started to tremble and people began screaming.

I've got three interpretations:

A) the quite literal meaning

B) the idea that even though the one-eyed man is king, he would still be a hugely misguided one. He can only see at maximum 2/3rds of normal vision at any one time, and will struggle to comprehend distances.

C) In the land of the blind, any man can claim to be one-eyed because nobody can actually see. So in a way, our real world is the land of the blind and our leaders are just those who claim to hold power (eg, having one eye) successfully through the fear/ignorance of the masses.

Side questions. A) are there any films about a land of blind people with a one-eyed king? B) Anybody know where the phrase comes from? C) How are you?

2xqijz,"How do I [20F] stop my panic attacks/anxiety? Well, here goes nothing. I'll try to keep it short, 
20F, used to be really depressed as a kid but definitely got better. Been in a really healthy place, workout 5x per week and eat a healthy diet. Low caffeine intake, no medications. 

Never had horrible anxiety but used to check the locks in my house frequently growing up before going to bed ( 2x per night, never considered it to be OCD or anything though) 

Smoked a little pot over the last two years, smoked a bowl, went to bed. A noise woke me up in the middle of the night (boyfriend closed the bedroom door) and I went into full on freak mode. My heart started pounding, thought I was going crazy, gonna have a heart attack or something, shaking, general freaking out. Now every time I'm around weed I have to try to fight to control my anxiety and have actually stopped smoking all together which sucks big time. 

Second issue - I feel the need to check things constantly. Examples: I put my wallet in my bag, walk 10 feet, must stop and check to see if I put my wallet in my bag/that it hasn't fallen out/that I haven't left it anywhere. A few nights ago I left my wallet in the car and woke up in the middle of the night in a panic wondering where I put it. Walked out to my car at 3:00AM in the snow because I HAD to know that it was still in there because I could not sleep. 
Same goes for triple checking my phone/keys/rings ect are still in my pockets/on my hands. 

This is really, really, REALLY annoying and I want to stop panicking every time I start wondering where I've put my wallet/keys ect. 

What can I do? I don't really feel like seeing a therapist because quite frankly I'm in university and work a lot and I don't really have the time or the finances to cover it. 

EDIT: Also get some crazy tingling in different sides of my head fairly frequently, especially in my forehead. I've heard this is a symptom of anxiety. Is this true?

tldr: Panic attack after smoking pot,  consistent anxiety over checking to make sure where I put my wallet/keys/ cell phone/rings etc. even though I KNOW where they are. What gives?

2x9a4b,"I told her how I feel, What now? Hey Reddit, Lets get some short context here.  Lets say, her name is Laura. A friend of mine is Steve. Steve and Laura dated in high school and when Steve went to collage he broke up with Laura because he cant keep his dick in his pants. Regardless Laura opened up to me and I found out she is just as screwed up as I am (maybe more) and that to me is attractive. 


Anyway, I waited about 3 months to tell her how I felt about her. I picked her up the weekend after Valentines day because it was snowy as fuck the week before. We went to B-Dubs because its her favorite place to eat. Smoked a bowel and took her home. About 2 miles from her house I admitted my feelings for her.  She said ""Awwww"" in one of those voices that you would talk to a baby or puppy with. Regardless our friendship hasn't changed, we still Skype and play video games together.  I just don't know where to go from here.  Laura is the most interesting woman I have ever met, She is a wonderful artist and she has great life goals. I guess I'm asking what to do next? I was thinking about seeing if she wanted to go out to dinner and a movie. I don't know reddit, I'm just so dumbfounded because in the past when I told a woman I had feelings for her, they would avoid me like the plague.

After two drug induced panic attacks in December I'm left grasping at the shattered remains of my mental process. Constantly obsessing over every thought or action. Every little pain or itch. Getting myself wrapped into tangential thought patterns concerning my friends, family, and future.

I'd always suffered from anxiety. I had a traumatic childhood. I thought I had beaten it. But it's clearly sticking around. Now I'm losing sleep, and constantly assuming that every thought tangent I have is another sign that I belong in a looney bin. Constantly tearing apart everything I see or think of until I find something wrong with it. Paranoia that my friends are talking about me behind my back, and purposely keeping me out of their lives. I know none of this is right or true. But I don't know how to convince myself of it.

I'm seeing now that I was never truly over it, but I was clearly on the road to recovery. Now I keep kicking myself for ever picking up a drug and fearing that I'll turn back to it.

2uwfm6,"Such a simple thing to most, felt like diving off a cliff for me just an hour ago. So, I haven't left my house for anything but the birth of my sisters first child (I missed the 2nd though), to see a Doctor, and... that's about it for 4 years now (I'm 18). 

But over the last couple days my Mums friend has being staying here until he can find a new place to stay after being kicked out of his Wives house or something, he's in a wheel chair due to MS so he doesn't have many options. 

But having some absurd social anxiety issues I can't handle him being here, so I've been in my messy ass bedroom for the last 3 days living off what ever I can get my hands on (Pepsi Max, chips and bread) during the 4 ish minute intervals of him wheeling outside for a smoke, and as you could imagine, it was/is really getting to me and making me feel trapped, which isn't new to me or anything after 4 years but I REALLY needed to get out and get some fresh air. 

So just an hour ago (I just got home) I grabbed $7 tied my hair back with a rubber band, put my Beanie and Hoody on (to hide my ridiculous hair) and walked down to a 24/7 Deli type thing about a half hour walk away at 4 AM. 

And fuck me dead... it was the strangest feeling, aside from looking over my shoulder every 0.45 seconds and having a border line panic attack every time a car drove past it was amazing, the wind felt like something new to me, and it smelt different than I'm used to, like walking into someone else's house or something. 

Then I reached the Deli, and grabbed a Peach Ice Tea and Eclipse Mints (which are amazing by the way) and nothing went wrong... nobody started laughing at me, nobody even noticed me until I walked up to the counter to buy my stuff, which sounds like nothing but every time I even think about being near people I feel like that's what will happen, no matter how irrational I know it is, and that's the fear that's kept me in my house for so long up until now. 

Sadly, it still felt pointless, and I have no desire to do it again, but it's definitely a step towards something, or at least I hope it is.

Oh, and also my wallet has like 600 dollars in it right now, which is a freakin significant amount to a college student. After throwing shit around my room in frustration I finally found my wallet lodged in an old bag under the corner of my bed since I accidentally passed out with it in my pocket last night.

This one is an ongoing position. The guy I'm replacing was there for months, but had an attitude problem so they're putting me in the position instead. I'll be making over a dollar more an hour, it's ten minutes from me and is 40 hours a week. 

My new job title is visual inspector. I'm going to be inspecting auto parts and either accepting or rejecting them, and the job is for an indefinite time period. I'm pretty excited. If I was still working at that retail job, I wouldn't have gotten this job. I start in the morning. 

Sometimes taking a risk pays off. Hope everyone had a great weekend!

2ui62f,"[Rant] Nobody's who's willing to help can do so. Nobody who can help is willing to. I have no health insurance. I'm suffering from Klonopin withdrawal. My life feels like a storm cloud. My family physician doesn't want to be my de facto therapist because that's not her field of expertise. She complained that I asked too much of her and used too much of her time when I made appointments with her. For a $25 copay, I apparently only get 15 minutes of face time with the doc. Fine, whatever.

Her office gives me the number of a clinic from which to get help. I call them-- they ascertain that they can't help me based on an evaluation done over the phone, but they give me the information of three OTHER clinics that might be able to help.

I leave a voice message with one, and I'm told that I'll get a response within a day or two. This was last Monday.

I call another. They don't accept the health insurance I had at the time.

The third is too far away from my home.

My physician, the same from above, also told me that she authorized my prescription for Klonopin at my local pharmacy. The pharmacy says otherwise. I was trying to get it before my insurance (provided through my father's employer until I'm 26 years old-- I turned 26 on Friday) ran out. Didn't happen. Now I'm alone in my bedroom every night trying to sleep and failing miserably, plus the physical symptoms that I'm going through from the withdrawal. The only way I can describe it is to say that I get extremely short (one or two seconds at the most) seizures/convulsions. It disrupts my concentration and stops me from doing whatever I was doing at the moment, and it feels like I got an electric shock to the brain. Sounds fun, right?

My anxiety is also killing my ability to function like a normal human, and asking my parents for support just makes me feel worse because I don't want to spread my anxiety to them by giving them reason to worry about me. I've never thought about suicide or self-harm, and that's one thing that I take solace in: the fact that no one who cares about me has to wonder if I'll hurt myself in any way. So when my dad asks at 4 AM if I'll be okay by myself until the morning because he's worried I'll do something self-destructive, that adds to the whirlwind of anxiety I'm already going through. The simple solution would be to just not bother my parents, right? It would be if I was equipped to handle major problems on my own. Don't ask. It'll make me feel worse to explain why.

I applied for Medicaid on the 5th of January in anticipation of my insurance expiring. I've been waiting since then and lost my patience last week, called them up and, in so many words, asked them what the fuck is taking so long.

""We have 30 days to process your application, sir.""

I can't *wait* 30 days. I can't wait a week to get a return call. I can't wait two weeks for my psychological evaluation to be completed so I can be told that I have to go somewhere else. I need help NOW.

Even if I *get* help, all of it becomes irrelevant if I can't get a new insurance plan. If that happens, everything's NOT going to end up fine despite the message that I see at the top of this page as I type this message.

Dear Diary,

I could hear the hysterical crying in the room.  The angry voice that rumbled through the night, like a thunderstorm about to lay siege on a newly grown seed.  I sat still and motionless.  Deer in the headlights.

I heard the sound of whipping.  It was terrible; I just held my ears and cried.  I cried for my brother.  I heard the thumping of loud, angry footsteps coming my way.  Oh no, if the beast saw my room, I would be in big trouble, too.  I turned out the light and shivered under my covers, hoping the beast thought I was asleep.  The footsteps pounded down the stairs; the beast had turned on the television.

It was safe.

I crept out of my room and into my brother's.  I asked him if he was all right, then I saw the angry, red welts that had risen on his arm.  I was shocked.  What else had happened?  He pulled off his shirt as if he had a sunburn.  The welts were slashes on his back like an angry cat had clawed him up.

I quivered with rage.  What did the beast think he was?  I picked up the traitorous whip (it was actually my brother's toy) to go confront the lion in its den; I went downstairs.

Dad.  

I held out the whip.  He rose like an angry storm cloud.  Yelled at me and hit me on the backside with the whip, then herded me upstairs.  I told him to look at my brother's back.  He returned, his face ashen.  He asked me if I was going to do anything.  I told him I was thinking about it.

It happened too fast.

First he ranted and raved...my brother wouldn't do this or listen to that, until he got physical.  I told him that no one can make a person angry, that is the way they react.  I told him that you make up your mind to be happy.  I told him what he had told me.

I told him if he ever hit me I would call the police.  He looked up with deadly anger in his voice.  ""If you ever call the police, I will throw you out of the house and disown you, daughter!""  I was stunned.  ""Leave the house now!  Just as you are!""  I stood up, but I was only in my night clothes.  ""Do you want to leave?!"" he asked viciously.

Of course I didn't.  

""Don't you ever call the police on me, don't underhand my authority.  Is that clear?""  I nodded, and replied ""But if you touch me, I would still call.  I love you, but I would still call,"" I said.  He held his head in his hands.  ""You are right.  I am saying things that I regret, that I don't mean.""  I would still call.

My brother sat shivering violently and sobbing.  Just rocking back and forth.  And I turned out the light.

Oh god.

1dxhoq,"I'm confused... we [20'sM, 20'sF] beat each other last week I came home really depressed for personal reasons. I wanted someone to talk to. I tried to talk to her, she wasn't paying attention because she was too busy with her freakin computer. I started telling her what I was feeling, sobbing. Then she insults me. She hates it that I complain about life, she didn't like that I said my sadness started after knowing of the gruesome way an ex-sex partner's mother died (this led to more personal conflicts), so she insults me. I was already hurt because she wasn't paying attention. I freak out completely and call her a whore, hit doors and walls like a child.

I go to my room to cry alone. I'm crying hard because I feel like shit. My child just saw us yelling at each other again. I was trying to calm down so I could talk to her camly. She enters the room. She says, ""go away from here"".

We start discussing, I'm trying to tone the argument down, she's saying I'm a loser, I'm fucked up, and selfish and petty and a crybaby. I accept all she's saying, but I tell her that if I' a crybaby, everyone else is. She says I don't know what a problem is, that I never knew poverty, I never starved as she did. I say this is true, but I say her mother was in depression for years because her husband cheated her, isn't that being a crybaby? She was sad because an uncle she didn't even cried to, wasn't that being a crybaby? I know this is something harsh to say, but I was trying to make a point that though I was suffering for personal issues of lack of self-steem, I wasn't any different from anyone else.

I keep saying these things, but I keep my tone down and try not to say it in an insulting way, while she's actively trying to insult me. But after some much, she gets pissed atwhat I say and slaps my face. My blood boils. I slap her face too. She slaps me back, and I slap her back. Now she's coming at me with a closed fist, and my fist is closed too and I'm seeing myself breaking the bitch's fucking teeth, and I get scared and start crying like a sissy ""Stooop! Stop hitting me!"" My voice makes her stop and so do I.

I feel shitty. I hit a woman. I shoudn't have reacted. Her face got bruised and she needed make up to go out. We figured it out already, but I don't know what to think about all this.

I don't want to react if she ever hits me again, but I don't know if I can. I try to control myself, but I lose my temper if someone hits me.

What happened? What can I do?

2y3svm,"I'm interested in a guy who only ever sees me in a lab coat Here's the thing: I'm a chemistry assistant, currently working on becoming a chemist, and I occasionally work alongside a nice fellow a year older than me. I'm very interested in him, and we've gone on a couple of ""dates"" (nothing serious, we payed for ourselves, talked about philosophy and life stuff). He even (and I still regret my reaction to this) tried to kiss me once. We were hanging out in the empty ballroom at our university playing on the piano and dancing and just having a good time after work and he got really close to me and smile and I choked out and said, ""I really want a Sprite"" (hint: I don't drink soda) and ran to the soda machine.

Some information about me, and my predicament: every time he sees me, every time he's started conversation with me or asked me out, has been while I had my hair back, wearing a lab coat, goggles, thick-framed glasses, and goggles. I'm average to below average looking (in my opinion): I have a gap in my front teeth, although not an overbite, I have a puggish face even while being thin, and I'm excessively nerdy. Seriously, I've been told that I could be a character on The Big Bang Theory (and I've never seen it, but I've heard that show is shit). 

I suppose I *am* smart. I started college when I was 16, I'm studying a science, and I love talking about my academic interests more than anything else. By no means a genius, and by a stretch above average. I just really like to learn. It's my thing. I also really like science fiction, especially books, and AI. Very well-rounded and sexy, I know. 

He started college at 16, too. But here's the difference: he's *hot*. He's incredible. 11/10. And he's a musician, among other things. I clean up *alright*, maybe reaching a strong 6/10. And I want to break out of my shell, ditch the thick-rimmed glasses, dress sexier, and impress him, but he would never see me doing those things even if I did! He only ever sees me (at first) in the lab, and I'm not sacrificing my safety in the lab to be a [sex kitten](http://imgur.com/BGOfRlN). 

So it's hopeless. There is no way a guy like him could like a girl like me, and he would never see me at my best, anyway, so it doesn't matter. So, should I just get over him, or are there ways that I can impress him even in the lab?

He's so sweet, well spoken, kind-hearted, and has the most gorgeous blue eyes. Every other message, he compliments me for my inner strength, or my joyful disposition, my writing skills.

But here's the thing. I have borderline personality disorder and GAD and he has social anxiety. Despite my conditions, I'm extremely extroverted. My crush appears to be an ambivert, he likes to go out and do social things sometimes but he does also enjoy being alone as well. As an only child, I can somewhat relate.

My question is, do relationships between two people with anxiety work, or do they crash and burn? I used to believe that I had to be with someone healthy in order to keep working on making progress with my own personal health, but are there any success stories out there?

I don't want to make things worse on both of us if chances are it's going to blow up in our faces.

2ysqqp,"What You Are Inside Only Matters Because of What It Makes You Do &gt;""I know I'm a good person on the inside.""

""You"" are nothing but the fruit.

Nobody cares about your dirt. ""Who you are inside"" is meaningless aside from what it produces for other people.

Inside, you have great compassion for poor people. Great. Does that result in you doing anything about it? ... Children die every day because millions of us tell ourselves that caring is just as good as doing....

How many of you are walking around right now saying, ""She/he would love me if she/he only knew what an interesting person I am!"" Really? How do all of your interesting thoughts and ideas manifest themselves in the world? What do they cause you to do? If your dream girl or guy had a hidden camera that followed you around for a month, would they be impressed with what they saw? Remember, they can't read your mind -- they can only observe. Would they want to be a part of that life?

Because all I'm asking you to do is apply the same standard to yourself that you apply to everyone else. Don't you have that annoying Christian friend whose only offer to help anyone ever is to ""pray for them""? Doesn't it drive you nuts? I'm not even commenting on whether or not prayer works; it doesn't change the fact that they chose the one type of help that doesn't require them to get off the sofa. They abstain from every vice, they think clean thoughts, their internal dirt is as pure as can be, but what fruit grows from it? And they should know this better than anybody -- I stole the fruit metaphor from the Bible. Jesus said something to the effect of ""a tree is judged by its fruit"" over and over and over. Granted, Jesus never said, ""If you want to work here, close."" No, he said, ""Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.""

Some other kid sat near us also, and this girl's friend came up to her, and while they were talking me and the other kid sort of chimed in, and eventually the other two left besides me and the girl.

We made some small talk, but I had to go so I just sort of said ""Nice meeting you, blah blah blah"" something like that (not the blah blah blah, obviously).

2drtpd,"Honest question about sexual abuse and effect of culture. Hi, I have a really basic but honest question. 

How does a child's brain become traumatized from sexual abuse from the early age if the abuse does not involve otherwise violent gestures? What component of the abuse is traumatic if a child doesn't understand sex? 

I remember as a child, we were taught about ""red flag touches"" and ""OK touches"" and were told about what parts of our body are deemed ""private."" Thinking back on this makes me wonder about how culture plays a role in the child's brain of interpreting sexual abuse. If we lived in a society wherein people commonly walked around naked with no distinctly ""private"" parts, how would a child be affected by a forced shoulder massage versus a forced sex act? What if we lived in a society where children would commonly witness consenting sex between parents? 

Do my questions make sense? I don't mean to diminish the horrible effects of abuse in any way. I understand what terrible things it can do to a person's psyche. I just want to put a question out there that has crossed my mind. Any input or recommended references would be appreciated.

2vtjp0,"Is it wise to be planning a round the world trip right now? Bit of backstory:

I'm 28 at the moment. I turn 29 in August. Up until last year, i spent most of my twenties living in Dublin, Ireland. I had a good steady job the whole time, lots of mates, and a nice girlfriend.  We had originally planned that when she'd finish her job in March, that we'd go travelling round the world together. Unfortunately, we broke up in the January instead and she moved away.


Furthermore, my work contract finished then so i was left unemployed and single. I still wanted to travel, but felt i couldnt just drop everything straight away and go alone. It'd take more time to plan than that.
So i went looking for jobs instead, with the intent to earn some money and plan a round world trip.

It then took a long 6 months of unemployment (which ate into my travel funds) before i finally got offered a job - down the country and away from everyone. But it was the only one i could get.

It's good and pays well, but my contract expires at the end of the year, and i don't know if i want to keep it going. Its not really what i want to continue with.

I still want to travel - i reckon i could leave next january, arrive back in july and be ok heading into my 30s where i can then think about finding a permanent job and somewhere to settle down.

But i'm kind of worried that i could come back to being unemployed for a long term again. My current job seems to imply that when my contract ends, it'll be no problem with me getting offered another contract or a permanent position.


Also complicating things is this: I've also started seeing someone who lives back in dublin, so i travel the 3 hours back every weekend to see her.  She's really nice, but i havent mentioned my desire to travel to her - i dont know if she'd be up for it too, or if itd be suitable for me to travel away for 6-8 months without her. 

Should i just press on with my plans to travel, or should i just leave it and get on with being an adult?

So, could these be signs of my dad being mentally ill, because I decided to look at my dad upon a psychological, and I am thinking that my dad is mentally ill, and the reason why he acts the way he is, but I would also like your opinion as you probably have more experience than I do with these types of situations, and if he does have a mental illness, what should I do about my dad?",abuse,"['could', 'dad', 'mental', 'illness', 'dad', 'believes', 'people', 'get', 'believe', 'work', 'fbi', 'type', 'agency', 'always', 'gets', 'stress', 'attack', 'leg', 'comes', 'home', 'serious', 'mood', 'swings', 'happy', 'extreme', 'anger', 'aggressiveness', 'always', 'repeats', 'insults', 'criticizes', 'every', 'detail', 'appearance', 'plus', 'would', 'criticize', 'direct', 'eye', 'contact', 'saying', 'makes', 'look', 'weird', 'looking', 'directly', 'eyes', 'plus', 'gets', 'really', 'aggressive', 'something', 'simple', 'turning', 'lights', 'house', 'save', 'electricity', 'calling', 'mentally', 'ill', 'going', 'room', 'take', 'shower', 'homework', 'plus', 'lies', 'make', 'seem', 'better', 'around', 'people', 'never', 'tells', 'mother', 'wrong', 'believing', 'always', 'right', 'even', 'wrong', 'plus', 'friends', 'would', 'two', 'brothers', 'best', 'friend', 'guy', 'met', 'working', 'previous', 'career', 'could', 'signs', 'dad', 'mentally', 'ill', 'decided', 'look', 'dad', 'upon', 'psychological', 'thinking', 'dad', 'mentally', 'ill', 'reason', 'acts', 'way', 'would', 'also', 'like', 'opinion', 'probably', 'experience', 'types', 'situations', 'mental', 'illness', 'dad']"
2wp1rf,"18m, fell in love with a person who's very far away, what should I do? Hi, I'm a 18 year old guy who's about to graduate HS this year and go off to college. Last year I met a girl at the end of the school year. I didn't really think much of it back then, besides the fact that it was cool that she shared some dorky interests of mine and that she was cute in an odd way (my favorite type). Since she was going off to college the next year, I didn't really try pursuing her - so I just dropped it, basically.
However, this year I became pretty good friends with her brother, who just happened to be in my grade level. I wasn't even aware that they were related until much later, it was a total coincidence. He jokingly suggested that I should date his sister several times (naturally I didn't think he was being serious).
This is where I actually this mild interested turned into ""something else"". I have been mildly depressed for 3 weeks, my mood reaching the absolute bottom of the shit barrel yesterday. Through some series of events and after hours of wallowing in self-pity I somehow found myself stumbling onto some sort of social media account that belongs to this girl. This was actually a total surprise and for some reason when I saw her face I experienced something beyond the typical lust or physical attraction that I usually felt for girls my age. In fact, I don't really remember a time where I felt that the emotional/mental attraction overpowered the physical, this would be truly the first time that would be the case. It was some sort of mental or emotional attraction and I really can't find a logical reason behind.
I really don't want to fuck this up. She comes over to visit her family during holidays and I'm really not sure what to do in a situation like this, where my reasons for being attracted are totally different from what I typically experience. Is it truly hopeless because of the distance? Should I ask my friend to help me break the ice somehow, being her flesh and blood and whatnot?

I'm very ashamed of this.  I hate myself for what I've done to them.  Amazingly, they haven't left me but God knows they've had every right to.  Our marriage is pretty much in tatters now.  We really have no intimacy because they're afraid of me and don't feel safe with me.  I can't even reassure them that it won't happen again!  I don't *want* to hurt my spouse, but that's never stopped me before.  We'd fight about something, and I'd get angry, and I'd lose my temper, and I'd hit them.  I don't even remember what we were fighting about except that once, I just wanted them to stop arguing with me (I lost the argument but didn't want to admit it).

We've talked about divorce, and my spouse honestly deserves someone better.  Someone who doesn't scare them.  Someone who will never hurt them.  But they do see some redeeming qualities in me, so they want to try to make it work.

Reddit, do you have any advice?  What can I do to guarantee that I can stay in control of my temper in the future?  What can I change to express my anger in a healthy way?  How can I stop being ""Scary Spouse""?  Can I ever make it up to my spouse for being such a bastard to them?  Can I ever be worthy of their love?

I'd like to take responsibility for the abuse I've done.  I'd like to take responsibility for changing.  Still, it's a cliche that abusers always tearfully apologize and swear to change, only to repeat the cycle.  How can I break the cycle?

However, she is recovering from anorexia and I think I may be triggering her to relapse which I don't want to do. But I don't want to eat. 

I think I'm too sad to eat. I'm just never hungry, and it feels so good to continue not eating or eating very little. I've been tracking what I'm eating and for the past few weeks it's varied between 160 calories a day to 800/day. 

My new friend noticed. She now asks me what I have eaten today and encourages me to eat and buys me food or asks me to dinners. I've been stupidly fighting her and telling her the truth. 

But now, she's kind of stopped. she tells me that I'm being unhealthy, but she herself has stopped eating her meals. I fought with her today for 45 minutes until she finally told me she made herself dinner, which I'm not sure I believe anyway. 

I want to keep restricting. I'm still 18 lbs overweight and I don't want to get extremely thin, that's not my goal. I'm more or less okay with my body. I just want to be happy and being empty makes me feel happier. But I don't want to hurt her or be a negative influence in her life. 

Therapy or other help is not an option for me at the moment, and probably not for her either. 

I don't want to have to resort to this, but I'm thinking about lying to her when she asks again. I'll tell her I ate things and she'll be proud and I won't be her trigger anymore and I'll get to keep on keeping on.

2xmabr,"Am I mature, or just boring? Hi! I'm a twenty year old guy. I'm an assistant general manager at a national retail store. I've been here for nearly 5 years now, so I know my job well and still love it (fortunately). I have two roommates, whom are very good friends I've had for years. 



However, I feel like I'm boring, but I've also been told I'm very mature, smart and realistic for my age. I love cooking, drinking, hanging out with my friends playing video games, playing with my puppy, and seeing this girl I'm talking too. My life is pretty much work and then home, nothing else exciting really, but I enjoy it. I was raised on the mindset of work hard and play hard, but I enjoy just relaxing after work. My two roommates love to go out and be active in parks and whatnot, but I just simply enjoy hanging out at home. They also don't work full time. I was never one for the party scene, I never felt it was necessary, I just enjoyed hanging out with a handful of people and talking about random topics, playing a game or watching a movie. I feel like I'm not as social or outgoing as I should be at times, or maybe that's just my personality. I honestly don't even know what I'm trying to get at here.

I find that most of my comments, civil comments mind you, that bring government or corporate intentions into question, such as Google becoming a cell phone carrier, are shadow deleted. This means that they show up to you as being posted, just no one has upvoted them, but if you view on the comment's permalink in incognito mode/not signed-in, you will find that your comment is actually deleted/missing for everyone else.

This is happening way more than people know, because, hey, who is actually going to click on a permalink on their comments and open in incognito mode?

I started checking this out a few weeks ago on another account (another computer), and I was really shocked at just how many comments, with 1 karma, had been shadow banned/deleted. These weren't angry comments, they were normally comments calling a corporation, or the government into question, and were posted on a wide variety of sub-reddits. This subreddit included.

Again, the comments show up on your account as there, just no one had upvoted it, but in reality it's gone.

If you attempt to bring this up on reddit, in almost any subreddit, the auto-moderator bot instantly removes it, or shadow deletes the post.

It starts where I began dating my now current boyfriend. Oh, I'm a female 20 and he is 22. Anyway, being a guy, he makes me meet his best friends. They all seemed to like me, which I greatly appreciated. They were super sweet. About a year of dating, I decided to move into his place. One of his best friends decided to move in a couple months later after being deployed. He was awesome. He had a smile that lit up a thousand planets and his humor was unforgettable. I considered him as my brother and he treated me as a little sister. We would all hang out and watch tv together and go out to eat and do fun college kids stuff. We had a great time. We decided to rent a house that had more space for the three of us. We move in and we couldn't be more happy. Everyone loved the house. We bought furniture and played video games and had fun times. We never had major issues. He was like a brother I never had and he always said that I was the sister he never wanted, jokingly. I absolutely felt so safe around him. He made my day. Being my boyfriend's best friend even reassured how close we will be. I wake up one day and see his truck parked outside the house. Thinking that he either just got home or is about to leave, because his car is running, I drove to school not knowing that anything was wrong. I come home a couple of hours later and find his truck still running and ask my boyfriend if he knows that it is still running. We go outside to discover that he had a head wound and there was a bullet hole through this window. We are not sure what happened and the police won't tell us anything, but ever since that discovery, my heart broke in half. I lost my best friend. I lost my safe feeling. I lost control of my emotions and I had lost my brother. He meant so much to me and I never got to tell him. I want him to come back and tell me everything is going to be okay. I still think that he will walk through the door and say he was on vacation or something, but I saw his body, and I won't ever unsee that. I just want some advice on how to handle this.

2xvj8b,"Very qualified. Crappy wage. Dispensable. Soon to be immigrating back home. Hey guys. So this is my first post on reddit, apologies if I don't get the format right. 

I need some advice about my job. The kind if advice I only see from objective redditors. 

So I work at a startup as a content marketer. I'm the only marketer, actually. Which has its ups and its downs... Mostly downs because the business seems to live or die with my efforts.

It's my first experience with marketing career-wise. I've been an English and history teacher, and administrator and I've 3 degrees - a BA in arts, ma in gender studies and a post grad in education. I know, I know.. No clear path. But that's just how things have worked out. 

I've been freelance writing for years, so that in combination with my other various professional jobs is what landed me this gig. At the time of getting the job, I was just happy to be making decent money from writing and not having to do crappy admin temp work anymore. 

My wage started at $30,000 CAD. 

Crap, I know. But I had no experience so I was happy with whatever.

Fast forward 9 months later, and double the website traffic, I decided that I should ask my boss if a raise would be on the table any time soon. He then proceeded to rip me to shreds and tell me how bad I've been doing at my job, that I'm dispensable, that I need up prove my worth and that I don't have the right to ask for any additional money.

I've had to pick up freelancing work just to pay my bills, and my days and weekends have started to blur into one constant writing blur. I'm depressed, poor and frustrated. 

And to make things even more complicated: I'm leaving Canada to head home soon. The job is remote so I thought I'd just take it with me. But now I'm not so sure. 

Am I right to want more compensation? I see others in roles that don't handle a fraction of the responsively that I do with much better pay than what I'm on and it just doesn't seem... Well... Fair.

10zetw,"Thoughts on my past? Hi Reddit,

I'm looking for some thoughts on what happened to me a few years ago. I was recently diagnosed with moderate-severe depression, and I feel like it is in part tied to an abusive (I think) relationship. He was the kind of guy every girl wanted to date- charming, cute, popular, etc. When I started to date him, I thought I had hit the jackpot. But then, things started changing when we became intimate. He would make me feel bad if I didn't give him oral sex, or try and guilt me into it. I didn't receive much in return at all. He made comments like ""I hope you don't become a slut when you get older"" and the like. When I broke up with him, and my friends asked what happened, they didn't believe me when I said he had been a jerk (I didn't go into detail). I was just seen as the angry ex.

I'm really struggling with this whole thing now. Frequently, I feel like my entire self worth is connected to how sexually pleasing I am. I will give oral sex if I feel like I've upset someone, and I know it's not healthy, but it's hard to stop when your brain sees it as a viable option. I feel like this is all my fault. I wasn't raped, I wasn't assaulted, I let this happen to me. 

Was this abuse? I feel like I'm the one who messed up.

I'm a 22 years old man. I live in Spain, near Barcelona. I want to start a new life far from here. Here I haven't a job. I started studying something 2 years ago that I had to leave because I couldn't pay. I stopped talking to my friends 6 months ago so I'm alone. I live with two relatives that I consider toxic people, and I have a huge willing to grow up, leave, and be someone. Far from here.

So I'm orphan of a police father and because of that I recieve some helps. One of them is an idioms school in a country where they speak the language. In July I'll go to either Toronto, Canada, or Liverpool, GB. I put Toronto as first priority and then Liverpool, so I'll almost surely will go to Toronto. I'll move with a family and I'll be studying for 6 weeks at an academy.



So I want to settle there. I have 6 weeks to find a job and somewhere to live. The ideal would be to share apartment so I have money to live and study.

How should I do it?

This is exactly how I feel. When I'm Hungover. I'm more wordy, confident, witty, funny, engaging. I feel like a completely different person. I feel most like myself. I perform better in essays and am closer to my family and friends. It's hard to explain but It doesn't matter how little sleep I'v had or how physically fatigued I am, I'm mentally fresh. 

When I'm sober, I have more brain fog, struggle to pick the right words, laugh less, more fatigued and generally less mentally stimulated.

I feel better during a hangover then while I'm drunk.


I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience. Or whether anyone knows what part of ones brain is stimulated during a hangover. 


Any help would be appreciated.

Roughly four years ago I started working for my state Fair as a mascot. It started as a very temporary job for extra money. However, I ended up really loving it. The high energy atmosphere, the performance aspect and being able to make people happy became an irresistible cocktail. 


At the end of year two I was offered a job with another company touring the states from fair to fair with them. I declined due to finding out details about the company that made me say no; it was an opportunity I wanted to say yes to. 


At the end of year three I had a friend's grandma offer to pay for me to return to school so I did. I've now been in school for one year. During that year I've also moved up to doing all special events for the fair grounds. I've had much more mascot experience and I wish I could do it more often. Obviously getting to go back to school virtually for free is something I'm insanely grateful for and an opportunity I don't want to throw away. 


Fast forward to yesterday I got a call from a entertainment company a good friend of mine works for. They are offering me the chance to apply for a full time touring position with their company. I wouldn't apply until July because I'd finish out the school year, but if I got the position I wouldn't return to school in the fall.

It's oddly timed. I was doing really well even though I was doing some triggering shit. I've felt close to recovery with the medication I'm on. I'm writing. I'm drawing. I'm sticking to my New Years Resolutions. I just feel like I've got my shit together.

Now I'm upsetting myself wondering what I actually feel about this. I'm oscillating between laughing and crying.

I know what I'm going to do tonight. I'm going to get drunk and put this off for another day, because I don't have the energy to really get into it tonight. I want one more day of recovery before I dredge everything up again.

I don't know what I want to do about my grandmother, who married him into the family. She's my dad's mother, his last remaining parent. She chose a predator over family, cutting us off except for the few times she ran into my little sister around town. She stood by a child molester, and I really wonder why. How fucked up is her thinking? Can our relationship be salvaged?

2xamih,"Confronting my roommate about her neglecting her dog My roommates and I believe that my roommate is neglecting her dog and it's been pretty upsetting to me for the last few weeks.

The dog is crate trained so she is left in the crate for hours and hours everyday. Typically, she lets the dog outside and feeds her at around 9 am, puts it back in the crate, and then doesn't get home until around 1 am. If she does come home during the day, she just lets the dog out until she goes to the bathroom and then puts it right back in the crate. This is an average of 15 hours a day in the crate without access to water or food. She has never taken the dog on a walk since moving in either. 

It really bothers me that her dog is so lonely all day and never gets the love and attention that she needs from her human companion. I don't think any animal should have to suffer because of its owner's negligence so I've been coming home in between classes and even avoiding leaving my home when I can so that it doesn't have to be in the crate all day. I make sure it is okay by letting it outside, giving it water, and trying to train it so that it won't develop bad behaviors and learn to be more obedient. I've even gotten it some things to chew to bite on because it is teething. She does not ask for anyone to help take care of her dog and I know that this is not my responsibility but I can't just leave it there all day.

Last night, I decided to stay up to confront my roommate about this problem and I ended up waiting until 4 am for her to come home and she never did. I have not physically seen her in about 3 weeks. I don't think that she is doing this intentionally. She seems like she just wanted to get a puppy because they're cute and the idea of having one sounded good to her but I don't think she realized the time and money that goes into having a pet. I have known her for a few years and she is a very sweet and caring person but this is absolutely not okay.

They're going to pay for most of my tuition, books, and give me study leave etc. And I love my job, so all of that is amazing. 

I've been obsessed with comedy since I was really young. And my undergrad is in media/comms, so I'm super into TV and writing and stories and all that. I've recently enrolled in a stand up comedy course which culminates in a 5 minute stand up gig. So the gig is on a Monday night. 

My question is, should I tell my boss the truth discreetly (so noone else finds out) and ask if I can take a vacation day the following day? Or should I just suck it up and go to work the next day instead of having a free day for a debrief/relax after my performance?

2ugdzz,"A few things to get my Monday rolling... Hi everyone, it's me again... haha! 
Hope everyone is well!

Well my week is already off to a great start! And I stress a **great** start. Where to begin? A few things need to be said for sure.

1. Last night I checked my email and I have a job interview next week for a drive-thru coffee shop in my city. A few thoughts going through my head about this - but for the most part I am feeling confident about the interview (it's a group interview) I'm sure I will really stand out. Any advice going into my interview would be very much appreciated! 
I'm also going to need to possibly see if I will need to get any clothes for my interview (any suggestions on what kind of clothes I should get for my interview?) 

2. Only a few hours ago I saw my Dad at my local train station - and I **deliberately** avoided him and stood right away from him. Long story short - I absolutely do not get along with anyone in my family except one brother who is an amazing person despite the fact he has schizophrenia! 
It's an oh so very long story as to why me and my parents don't get along - I honestly don't know why they don't. Truly! I'm a beautiful soul according to many people... so yeah!
Should I feel bad that I did what I did this morning? A reason I could suggest as to why I did avoid him is because the second I saw him I felt my radiant mood just drop very dramatically and emphatically. I don't know how else to explain it - other than a very sudden plummet in my mood. I was just trying to protect myself - I am an adult and I can do what I want in the world now. And I stand by my decision this morning - I mean I don't think I caused any harm. 

3. Today I learned that all the English words for the days of the week have Old English etymologies. *ALL* of them! Can anyone suggest why this might be - I thought it was especially curious. Haha!

Got to go to the doctors because of ED.
Thanks mum, you sure did fuck me right up.
No therapy this week and failed my mod 1 bike test.
Existential crisis.
Where is the point in life if I feel so detached?
Everything is just a minor distraction from how I feel.
Where is the point in feeling nothing?
I love a beautiful woman
And yet sex is shit, as, well I feel nothing during sex.
The intimacy is missing something.
Something incredibly deep.
something with real meaning.
Something that would really make me feel alive.
So far nothing comes close to adrenaline. 
Existence feels pointless.
I'm not depressed.
I just don't see a point.

2vg08a,"Dentist office success! I haven't been to the dentist in close to ten years. Severe social anxiety has kept me from a lot of fun things, activities, and I was rapidly realizing I was letting it impede my health check ups, too and not just my close to zilch social life and driving anxieties.

I finally broke down and decided to book an appointment. For my eyes, my physical, and my teeth.

Made excuses and rescheduled my physical twice. Rescheduled eye appointment 3 times. Finally went to both and needed two days of recovery time after of quiet and calm before I could regulate. Whatever. The biggest thing was I got them done, and learned that I not only needed a new Rx for my glasses, but that I had some lumps in my breasts that required attention. (!!! - so glad I got checked!!)

But the dentist was an all new beast. For weeks I dreaded this appointment. I made excuses, tried to talk myself out of going and even had a panic attack as I was sitting in the car in front of the office. 

I was obscenely early ( like always ) for the appointment and immediately thought I should just go home. I knew if I didn't go in right then I would cancel and hate myself for it later.

So I took a deep breath and went in. I felt myself getting very upset through the appt but only because I was beating myself up. My teeth were in surprisingly good shape. I do need a few more follow up appointments, but no cavities and my teeth feel so much better.

It was such a small victory to other people but to me it was really great feeling like I had pushed away the anxiety long enough to take care of myself.

2xv61y,"Need some advice regarding sickness at work. Hi guys, throwaway because. UK.

I'm currently off sick from work, I've got a really gross flu which means I've been off work on Thursday, had a day of holiday booked off on Friday, managed to turn up for an overtime shift on Sunday (even though I was clearly unwell) and I have been off Monday and Tuesday.

Now I was under review because I'd had 12.5 sick days off when I'd been working for about 5 months. I work nightshift so it took me a while to adjust, and I was placed on an allowance of 3 sick days until ""March"", which I'm now assuming means the end of the month. I'd done fine until now, but honestly probably caught something at work and now I'm laid up in bed.

I emailed my supervisor that I couldn't come in, and he told me I'd need a fitnote from the doctor. I went to the doctor, and they told me I have to be sick for a full week before I am eligible for a sicknote. As I was ill for one day last week, had a holiday off, made it in for my Sunday shift, but have been ill for two days this week, it does not count. 

My supervisor is arguing that this is, in fact, a full week. He is including both my holiday and the weekend in the calculation and I feel a bit cheated by this. I also feel mislead that ""March"" in fact meant the end of March. I've been working 8 months now, and honestly feel 15ish days is not so bad for this time frame. By a year, if I happen to have three more days, that would be 18.5 days. Now this is definitely above average, but baring in mind this is my first job, I felt the stresses, and have managed to get back on my feet, I don't think this is too bad. 30 days off in a year I understand is unacceptable, however I'm not at this limit yet.

I feel upset, I'm still ill, and I feel like I'm being told off for being a human being. I'm not sure if I have any ground to stand on. Adjusting to nightshift has been tough anyway but I don't really think this treatment is fair. I'm probably going to have to have a meeting in which all I can do is say ""I was ill, I am actually fine except human"", I have no idea what else to say.

My daughter secretly taped a meeting she had with her foster caregiver and her CPS worker in July. In the tape they clearly ask her what is her goal for the next while while in care. She stated to return home to us permantly. So she was told our home had to be deemed mentally and physical safe. My daughter is 14. She said obviously it is because her baby brother(10 months old now) is safe here. That is when she was given a veiled threat and told ""That is because they just have not taken him yet."" They threatened her because she is fighting for her rights, got herself an advocate from the Child and Youth Advocate and learned that most of her rights while in care have been denied her. So they have cut contact between herself and her 2 brothers who are still with the family who is considering adopting them. They knew how hurt she was with being refused contact with them and so they threated her baby brother even though that CPS worker is not in our jurisdiction. When our community supper worker(who is in our home every week and has watch our son grow from the very first day he was brought home) heard the tape she was shocked. She then assured our daughter that if CPS here had any issues with us or our home the first call they would make would be to her and she would let them know that all is well. A few weeks later the foster caregiver was laying into my daughter over something. She is constantly trying to start fights with my daughter to the point of my daughter spending most of her time in her room to avoid the fights. My daughter broke and told her about her not trusting her any more because of threatening her brother. The foster caregiver denied the whole thing. So my daughter let her know she caught it on tape. She then started yelling at my daughter about how illegal that is. My daughter told her she was welcome to contact me to find out the law where it states as long as you are a part of the conversation you can legally tape it without notifying anyone else. But you have to be a part of the conversation to do that. She sent her to her room. The next morning she was all apologetic saying they should not have said those things and she was angry and sorry. So now it is a wait and see what happens next as we continue our fight to reunite out family.

2wujxf,"Concern with FWB situation of 6 months. I'm honestly not sure where to begin here. This guy who we shall call Brad and I met on Tinder about 6 months ago and have been basically inseparable since during our free time. I originally got Tinder after breaking up with an ex and honestly just wanting to talk to more people however did not know if I ever would meet anyone. He was on it for sex which he made clear the first time we hung out however with time this seemed to change action wise. I've done FWB situations for longer periods of time with no issues but this is different. I was smart enough to keep it only to sex.. no snuggling, going out on dates, PDA, taking care of him after surgery/while he's sick, meeting their friends and everything. This time it is beginning to feel really terrible on my end of the deal. It's mind fucking me pretty terribly. 

Tonight, I brought it up with Brad. I broke down crying mid talk which I really wish he did not see but he did not seem to mind. He basically told me he was happy with the way things are now and he was just afraid to add the 'bad' parts of relationships in. This honestly still sounds like total BS to me. I told him it was starting to get extremely confusing because we'd been hanging for so long/frequent/have acted so coupley. I know it's just a label and I feel dumb for this. I told him that I might have to stop our hangouts because it is starting to mind fuck me and I think I might want something more committed in the near future. He basically told me he understands however we are having fun so why stop.. While I am dating other guys we could still continue our time together then if I found someone I was interested in enough we could have this talk again. I don't know why I did not ask him to clarify when he said this because I am honestly unsure if he meant then he'd consider wanting to be legit vs talking about needing to stop hanging. 

I cannot decide if I should be continuing with this or looking for someone else. I am extremely afraid to do something/not do something I will end up regretting. Any advice is appreciated.

1glqy0,"It's weird, but I need a stuffed animal So, I'm doing this therapy called somatic experiencing to try and help manage my PTSD symptoms that stem from childhood sexual abuse/incest. The therapy is really resonating with me, and I'm finding it particularly helpful in dealing with anxiety and flashbacks.
However, the stage I'm in requires a ""comfort object"" to hold and focus on. It sounds hokey and all woowoo, but the concept behind it makes sense. Basically you get yourself into a safe/comfortable space and then focus on the bodily sensation of being safe. Over time, you're able to trigger these sensations of calm and safety just by thinking ""I'm safe."" 
Problem is, I have no comfort object. I feel dumb buying myself one, and way too embarrassed to ask someone to buy one for me (plus, I don't really have people in my life that are aware of my experiences). 
So this has become a ridiculous sticking point for me, and it's triggering anxiety for me - in particular social anxiety, because I feel like the people at the store will think I'm a weirdo for buying a stuffed animal as a grown adult. It also doesn't feel ""nurturing"" and ""comforting"" to just go out and buy myself one. I know it's irrational, but that's just the nature of anxiety I guess. 

So, I know it's weird, but any suggestions on how to go about this? Maybe a way to ask a friend to buy me one without having to explain the whole thing? Or maybe a way to partially explain it without sounding like a wierdo? Or perhaps a way to buy one for myself and still have it be a nurturing/non-anxious experience? That makes me anxious too though. I've been stuck on this for a few weeks now, it's super frustrating. Even talking about it here is making me anxious, but hey, at least it's anonymous.

2uwxbt,"Need help with the aftermath of a breakup Hey everyone,


I just had broken up with my girlfriend of about 2 years. She had bought a house about 6 months ago and I moved in with her and her daughter. She isn't very financially sound but, I agreed to pay her 600 in 'rent' every month which was about half the bills. We never had any formal agreement (legally), I just said I would pay that.

I had moved all my stuff in and helped pay for a lot of other stuff around the house also, which probably amounted in the thousands.

We got into a 'fight' on a Friday a couple weeks ago and she asked me to move out. I did, I went to my parents with some stuff.
We officially broke up last week Wednesday (28th). I asked her then when she wanted me to move my stuff, she said whenever or whenever I get my own place. Then after I think realizing we weren't getting back together she said ASAP. I then asked her a good time and she said she wanted to be there and have the child not there...Which limits it to every other weekend (which the breakup made it fall on an 'on' weekend with the child) and Wednesday nights for a couple hours.

I told her I was just going to take all my stuff last night and then Saturday morning. She then asked for my 600 for rent since my stuff wasn't gone. She then complained how she didn't plan for this and didn't have any money so I need to pay her. I rebuffed that and she backed off.

I also pay for the Internet in the house and wanted to get that switched, but I would need to cancel and pay the whole fee of 200+, which I didn't want to do. The ex wanted to get her own to bundle and save money. I offered a compromise and offered to pay for the Internet until I get a house then pay her what she would have saved. She was then asking for the 600 AGAIN and said my stuff is still there and any other landlord would make me pay for another month. I was then just sure I was going to just cancel it and say screw it.

What makes it more complicated is we got a dog (Her idea 100%) but she hates the dog and I love it. I wanted the dog, but don't have a place for it right now though, so she is keeping it for now.

She seems to be going downhill saying that she could just change the locks and make sure I can't get in (which I am sure she would do)

I am now planning on getting my stuff out tomorrow afternoon while she is at work, but can't get the dog out. 

Any advice on what I can do? I am afraid that she will get rid of the dog to get back at me for not paying.

Should I pay her the money? Just give her a little bit? Am I the idiot or am I being reasonable with this?

2uiquh,"Totally unhappy in college So this is my first time posting on this subreddit and I'm not sure how things usually go around here, but here goes nothing. I'm a student at a top 50 university in the US. It's only been one year here but I'm completely unhappy with my school. 

Some background. I'm from a small city up north and I moved down here for college, the transition wasn't really hard because I hated my home town so much I couldn't wait to leave. For years my parents were constantly talking about how great the city I'm going to college in is, they'd take me here on vacation all the time, they love this place. The problem is that I don't. When I was applying for colleges and would bring up a university that wasn't here or my ""backup"" they would just steer the conversation towards here again, so I only ended up applying to two universities. 

The college is in a major city that's pretty much known for partying 24/7. I'm talking underage drinking every night, loose drug laws, pretty much debauchery. Meanwhile I don't drink, I don't smoke, and I'm abstinent. All choices that I've made. People down here, all they do is go out and party and I just can't have fun in that lifestyle so I don't go out most nights because there's nothing for me to do. There's so much fun stuff to do here but no one does any of it sober. Once people find out that I don't party like they do, they exclude me from their lives and I pretty much never see them again.

I've been seriously considering transferring to a different university, preferably one higher ranked. I know that drinking is a big part of college life but it's a totally different story down here. It is life down here, but it's not the life for me. Despite not even being here a full year, at the end of this semester I'll have 60 credits fulfilled and be considered a Junior which means I'll graduate an entire year early. I worked really hard to get those credits and am terrified of losing them.

 I have several ideal places picked out, and I'm sure I can get into at least one of them, but the idea of disappointing my parents is my main deterrent. The day that I told them I got in here was one of the happiest days of their lives. I saw them both cry from excitement and happiness, but inside I couldn't care less. 

I've also got a pretty decent scholarship to my current university, but I think it might transfer over to any college I go to. There's also the fact that I applied to be an RA so if I get that job then all of my finances will be covered for college, so I'd pretty much be stuck in a place where I'm unhappy but financially safe.

2uaq91,"One of my biggest fears is making mistakes. And I don't mean that as a whimsical euphemism for a fear of failure or letting someone down; no, I fear fucking up. Because I do it all the time. What got me thinking about this was when I missed at university exam yesterday, because I read the wrong time and came too late. When I was working at a shop over Christmas, I would frequently (at least once per shift,) forget to give change to at least one customer, and have to ask the manager to open the till; I was so embarrassed about doing this every time that I developed a habit of holding the till open, until I was sure that the customer was satisfied and the change had been handed over. It helped, but didn't always work. And the second the till closed and the customer looked at me quizzically, the word ""Change?"" forming on their mouths, my stomach dropped and my heart beat faster and the words ""Shitshitshitshit"" ran through my mind.

Yesterday, I watched an interesting [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFWyseydTkQ) about getting over the fear of rejection by exposure therapy: get rejected many times, in order to stop worrying about rejection. It's a nice idea, but it's totally not applicable in this situation: I can't fix a fear of mistakes by making lots of mistakes, because that's only going to make my life a lot worse. The point of mistakes, I always thought, is that you learn from them, so you don't do them again. Thus, my question: if I fear mistakes, does that mean I haven't learned? That I'm not learning fast enough? That there's some bigger problem going on in my absent-minded brain?

Our flight was overbooked so we got bumped, and they rescheduled us for a 5pm flight to Miami. Due to maintenance issues on the flight coming in on what was soon to be our plane, our flight got delayed roughly 2 hours, meaning we would miss our connection. The next flight from Miami to Tampa is at 10am this morning, so we decided to just go on the flight to Miami, the airline would put us up at a hotel for the night. The gate agents at Logan confirmed that this plan would work, and said that they'd hook us up with a hotel once we arrived in Miami. To our dismay, once we arrived, we learned that all the hotels in Miami are booked. The airline reps here even went as far as to say that the gate agents at Logan shouldn't have sent us here, and that they told everyone to avoid sending people to Miami who needed to stay the night.

One of these monster-moms contained a hidden catapult that would send the snuggling infant flying across the cage.  The most horrifying model was the one Harlow, ever the scientific showman, called the ""iron maiden.""  Inside it was a rack of retractable brass spikes that could stab the clinging baby at any moment. 

No matter what Harlow did to the infants, he couldn't destroy their loyalty to their fake mothers.  Even after being stabbed by the iron maiden, once the spikes had retracted the infant would return to it, seeking comfort.

2xl5yi,"Being addicted to heroin is literally a pain in the ass. When you become a heroin addict a few things in your life change.

You hang out with your friends less because, well they don't do fucking heroin and probably aren't going to tolerate you doing it in front of them.

You literally never have money. Sure you might have money in your pocket when you wake up, or money in your bank account but guess where it will all eventually go towards? HEROIN.

The only thing you find yourself thinking about is where your next bag of dope is coming from. You'll tear your house apart looking for something to sell or trade for a fucking bag of powder.

HOWEVER

The biggest pain in the ass that heroin causes, is literally a pain from your ass.

YOU WILL NEVER KNOW TRUE PAIN LIKE A HEROIN LACED BOWEL MOVEMENT.

I have shed buckets of tears, with my asshole crowned like a danish king over a toilet in a dunkin donuts bathroom. Praying to Egyptian gods to pass what feels like a frozen hockey puck. 

It's not like this happens every once in a while. This type of shitting takes place every single fucking time you have to poop. You no longer saunter to the bathroom phone in hand ready to play some fruit ninja or catch up on snapchat stories.

You are now a seasoned veteran with PTSD and trembling hands looking up new age mediation techniques on your iphone so you don't pass out from the pain of giving birth to what feels like a geode of volcanic rock. 

The least glamorous parts of addiction almost always take place in the bathroom.

I want to be angry.  I actively choose it day to day over the anxiety, insecurities, fears, and weaknesses that actually exist underneath.  My anger doesn't exist, it's a figment of my imagination that I create to protect myself.  And I don't want to let go of it.  I want to wrap myself in it like a heavy blanket and keep out the cold.  I want to let it yell at people and push my loved ones away because it's protecting me. 

Anger is all I have.  I probably have youngest child syndrome, definitely PTSD, some anxiety, I may be a tad sociopathic...

But when I'm angry, that weak shit disappears.  I feel powerful even though I sound like a vile idiot bigot.  I feel in control even though I've completely lost it.  

I'm angry because I can't let go. 

I can't lose.

I wear my anger like a badge of goddamn honor.

It has saved me.  It has saved my life.  It's protecting me and keeping me strong. 

No.  It's destroying me. 

I live in a shit cycle of madness, basically belligerent, hurting others, feeling awful about myself, and then getting angry at myself for all of that.  

My life is anger.

2twuho,"Need to clear my mind. I really wanted to harm someone. Earlier today, I found out that my uncle didn't have much time left. It was okay, because I told him everything I needed to, and that I loved him. My mom died of the same thing, lung cancer, a year ago. In a way, I was glad that he was going to be at peace. I called up my cousin and he got me a buddy pass to fly home tonight. The drive to the airport was horrendous. I was stuck in traffic for about an hour for what should have only taken me twenty minutes, so I missed my flight. At that point I was a little upset, but I was still okay. However as I was driving home, I tried to signal into another lane when I saw that the one I was in was a turn only lane. This bastard in a green truck sped up when I signaled and wouldn't let me in. I sped up to make it through, but he was deliberately forcing me out. He ran me off to the side of the road, and smirked as he passed. I couldn't tell you how much I literally wanted to kill him. I wanted to follow him home and bust his knee caps, slash his tires, and key up his car. I really did try to follow him, but lost track through all the merging of traffic. The entire ride home, I couldn't help but scream, curse, and slam my steering wheel. It was like uncontrollable rage that made my body shake. I drive a manual and couldn't properly engage/disengage the clutch, because I was shaking that bad. I just want to get a drink to calm myself right now.

2v32xo,"Living situation dilemma. Need to get out of this funk. Background: I'm in my late 20s living in London, just got a decent-ish job (27k) but I'm currently living the grind.

My current living situation: I'm lodging with some family friends, and have done so for about 2 years now. It's cheap, cheap for London, real cheap. If I move out I will likely end up paying double of what I am currently.

The thing is, I don't have a contract, or anything, never had one in London. It's a flat monthly fee, and it's stress free. I've saved almost 5-6k over 2 years just by living here and not moving. But it's so damned restrictive.

I have my room, that's it. Everything else is shared with the couple I lodge with. It's so awkward to intrude on their daily lives, and I've never had friends round. 

Everytime I hit that limit, that ""that's it, I gotta move"" notion, I think about all the money I'm saving, money which I can spend on going on holiday, going out with friends, buying things, saving.

But then again, I feel so restricted, creatively and otherwise. I fear without peers to push me, I'm creatively barren. I feel dull, I cannot surround myself with people I admire, or invite them round my place in appreciation, and I feel like I'm completely missing out on life living with friends. I've never had the opportunity to live with friends, things never worked out that way.

He left for a couple days but comes back tomorrow and leaves again the next day. He will be home for probably about 16 hours probably in between travelling.

I'm done. I feed the cat and replace the litter. I am now pissed at how someone can be so inconsiderate. I tell my girlfriend that we are not watching that cat for this person. She tells me to pump the brakes and we talk it out. 

We are leaving a note for the guy that we are sorry to put him in the situation of not having someone to watch his cat but we cannot watch him anymore. I'm not sure if we are going to give reasons as to why we can't watch the cat. 

Am I the asshole here or is he the asshole? It's probably a bit of both but I feel disrespected for this guy not doing anything to make things easier for us (which should be a common courtesy).",non_abuse,"['neighbors', 'cat', 'somewhat', 'long', 'gf', 'moved', 'new', 'place', 'june', 'still', 'met', 'anyone', 'really', 'really', 'care', 'neighbor', 'comes', 'randomly', 'last', 'week', 'asks', 'us', 'feed', 'cat', 'change', 'litter', 'nearly', 'three', 'weeks', 'country', 'offer', 'money', 'really', 'say', 'anything', 'stunned', 'guess', 'fear', 'disappointing', 'someone', 'sad', 'yes', 'invites', 'us', 'show', 'us', 'food', 'litter', 'come', 'disgustingly', 'dirty', 'shit', 'piss', 'litter', 'box', 'crap', 'laying', 'everywhere', 'reluctantly', 'still', 'go', 'left', 'couple', 'days', 'comes', 'back', 'tomorrow', 'leaves', 'next', 'day', 'home', 'probably', 'hours', 'probably', 'travelling', 'go', 'tonight', 'cat', 'piss', 'shit', 'litter', 'box', 'trash', 'bag', 'put', 'dirty', 'litter', 'litter', 'bathroom', 'even', 'replace', 'dirty', 'litter', 'roam', 'around', 'apartment', 'look', 'litter', 'trashbag', 'done', 'feed', 'cat', 'replace', 'litter', 'pissed', 'someone', 'inconsiderate', 'tell', 'girlfriend', 'watching', 'cat', 'person', 'tells', 'pump', 'brakes', 'talk', 'leaving', 'note', 'guy', 'sorry', 'put', 'situation', 'someone', 'watch', 'cat', 'watch', 'anymore', 'sure', 'going', 'give', 'reasons', 'watch', 'cat', 'asshole', 'asshole', 'probably', 'bit', 'feel', 'disrespected', 'guy', 'anything', 'make', 'things', 'easier', 'us', 'common', 'courtesy']"

2vdld3,"I had a near perfect Saturday night. I was over at a friend's house for a cast party that marked the end of a most terrible show called ""Wonderland."" It started off really chill, but escalated pretty quickly to being crazy. At least as crazy as us introverts who don't abuse substances get.

A little while after that, my crush showed up. nbd, I'll just keep watching The World's End, then maybe I'll try something. Greatest fucking movie I've ever seen. She seems to think the same, but she's confused because she wasn't there for the whole thing.

Move to a corner with her, some of her friends, and some of mine. She's pretty fucking weird, but the good kind. My buddies are there to help keeping me from fucking up, doing pretty fucking well w/o their help though.

3 hrs left in the party, a horror movie is put on. Both of us get bored by those, so we play the question game with a bunch of plebian freshmen. They're pretty chill actually, just scared of that stuff. 

The two of us start out separated, but she soon invites me to sit next to her.

2 hrs to go, and I have decided that I'm going to ask her out if my flirting goes well. Starts small; just sitting close to her, doing some very subtle footsie. Then I had to pee, so I did; Sue me.

1 hr left. The group shifts. We end up separated again...shit. I have to pee. someone takes my spot again, and with 50 minutes to go, I get invited next to her again. We start flirting harder, the time is coming near.

30 minutes to go: We're holding hands and really close together now. Some really pretentious and awkward girls says me for the question, ""who would you kiss?"" No clue what to do about that, but I don't give a shit. The night was nearly perfect.

2 minutes to go, my turn to ask a question. Hurry the fuck up, OP! It gets passed her.

30 seconds: I lean over to ask her out...""K bud, its time to go!"" *fuck!* ""K, bye OP's crush..."" ""Bye OP! see you later!""

Sulk to car after sister kisses her boyfriend goodbye. :'( Get in the car. ""Motherfucker!"" Sister doesn't get reference to The World's End because she showed up late to the party. Have to explain the reference and why I made it. She feels bad. can't blame her. It wasn't her fault.

2y4g30,"I'm in an abusive relationship, and I don't know what to do, or where to go. Please help. (Kind of long, sorry) I've been with my current boyfriend for almost 3 years now. He started abusing me about a year into it. He was usually drunk and afterwards apologetic, so I usually just brushed it off and put it out of my head. I've spent my entire life being physically, sexually, and mentally abused by one person after another, so at first I just put it up with it. It wasn't until the abuse actually caused me to have to go to the emergency room with a severe concussion after slamming my head into my granite night stand then into our hardwood bedroom floor while simultaneously choking me. After that, things really started to get crazy and violent. He kept me under his thumb in debt and guilt. I work for him, and he holds that over my head, and puts me through constant guilt trips any time that I threaten to leave saying that I am screwing him over with the business if I leave. Two months ago, he attacked me two separate times completely sober, and even threatened to kill my dog. That's when I realized that he was going to kill me if I didn't get out. I finally convinced him to let me get a new job, so I started working out a plan. I could get a new job(preferably an easily transferable one-out of state) and then quit working for him, then transfer back to Texas where I am from. I've been slowly working through my plan, going through the motions, trying not to make anything seem obvious. That was all great until tonight. Tonight he came home from the bar, and started screaming at me to give him his car keys (I've been using his, bc mine broke down and is in the shop). I told him no, that he had been drinking and I have to work in the morning, at his business, and I would need the car, so he needed to just have his friend drive him(his friend was sitting in the next room this entire time). He then started choking me and screaming at me that he would kill me if I didn't give him his keys, so I finally just gave them to him. I am scared. I don't know what to do. I don't want to call the police, but I also don't want to die. I have no money. I have no savings. 
Details on personal situation:
He is 41, I am 27. I have an 8 year old son from a past relationship, he has 3 young girls from a past relationship. None of them have ever seen his abuse towards me(thankfully). We live together, and I work for him as a bartender and manager. On top of the physical abuse, he is constantly verbally abusing me, calling me a fat ass(I weigh 130 and am 5'6) a whore(have never cheated on him), a crazy bitch, stupid, ugly, etc etc etc.

2k25vv,"Returning to uni, questions, blame Ive been back in uni for about a month. It had happened when i was in the second year. I didnt finish my second year as i was really unwell. I took a year out and now i've returned to do my second year again whilst the people i used to know are in their fourth. The ones that have spotted me around uni have been smiley and friendly and have asked me things like, 'did you go travelling?', 'you're in third year now right?'. To the former, i put on a smile and say i did and to the latter i say how silly i was to leave before finishing the year so i have to re do it and they accept it as truth. 

As part of my agreement with my uni ive had to see various departments and have to continue seeing these groups throughout the year as well as occupational health screening regularly-- so it's been a really busy few weeks. At one meeting they forwarded the details of the psychological services, so i went ahead and fully answered the in depth questions they require when signing up. I went to the meeting assigned to me. The psychologist asked me more in depth questions, told me that no help would be offered to me, asked me some more questions, then asked me three specific questions that have been playing over and over in my head: have you managed to have sex? Did you enjoy the sex? (He then asked about my previous relationships to which, i replied, that my current partner was my only real relationship which led to ) - did you lose your virginity to your boyfriend?
 
I was in shock, i muddled my words but was finally able to answer with my voice shaking. He then told me that my problems were to complex for them to deal with. I accepted his words, thanked him for seeing me, then walked off , trying my best not to burst into tears. What he asked and the way he asked them still make me feel really uncomfortable. Ive relapsed into panic episodes and sleeplessness. Sometimes, i will see this man besides my abuser, other times, beside my old friends with the things they have said to me playing on repeat.  
Today I saw an old friend (at her request), she jokingly called me slutty. And also had a go at me for being 'rude', and 'awkward' to an old class mate i had come across that assumed i went travelling in my gap year.  Also, proclaimed i had some sort of prejudice against my old classmates whilst we were on the train ( a lot of them have similar cultural and religious background). Tonight the speeches on repeat have been hers and the psychologists. Its half 3am and i need to wake up early. Im slutty. Rude. Racist. Slutty. If i was really raped i shouldn't have sex. I shouldn't enjoy sex. I can't orgasm now because i feel disgusted with myself. 

There is no use in me complaining. I should have said to him that his questions made me feel uncomfortable (violated). I should have told her that seeing all of them makes me feel inadequate, i feel like a failure, they ask a lot of intrusive questions (unknowingly) that flare up my anxiety and put me in a negative mental state for several days afterwards.

2uxtxr,"[HELP] I need to be constantly distracted from myself to a point that's pathological and hurting my life deeply and I am lost. (I've been a long time lurker but this is a throaway because reasons.)

I can't be alone just with my thoughts. I need an audiobook or a youtube video in the background, or a song, or a book to read or something. 

If I am not being distracted constantly I start feeling really really bad, like anxiety is tightening around my neck. For example, if I am watching TV and want to pee, I'll first unlock my phone without pausing the TV, put some youtube video on it or launch reddit, then start walking towards the bathroom while watching/reading it, do my thing and come back. 

It's become so ridiculous that if I don't find anything to distract me I might not even go to the toilet until I just can't hold it any longer, at which point I'll go running to another room to fetch an tablet or something and look something up while I pee. 

I cannot be ""alone"",  I mean not-distracted, the feelings are so so terrible and FUCKING AWFUL

This really becomes a problem at night because I can't CHOOSE to go to bed. I am incapable of just putting away the book/phone/tablet/laptop/whatever and close my eyes. It literally hurts. And so the only ways for me to fall asleep are getting drunk, taking a ton of anxiety medication and hipnotics, or sometimes when I haven't slept in days I'll be able to fall asleep for 5 hours, but as soon as I wake up the pain starts again and I need to grab my phone and look at twitter or check my email, or take a book and start reading or something and I can't choose to put it down again. 

I don't know what to do. This has been going on for months but it was somewhat bearable, now it's getting worse. 

Does anyone relate to what I said? Am I alone in this? What advice do you guys have? I am so fucking lost. I am crying. I don't want to be like this forever.

2vve33,"What can I do to help my neighbor? Last night, around 1:00AM, my husband and I are in bed. Our daughter had just woke up and crawled into bed with us, so we were both kind of half-awake. Less than 5 minutes later, we hear a scream and someone starts beating on the door. My husband went down and saw our female neighbor bleeding and in bad shape. She lives on the first floor of the house with her boyfriend, while we have the second and third floor. He had hit her and she had bruises on her throat from being choked. She also had a possibly broken hand. We got her cleaned up and called the police. We are not sure what they did with him, but we know he was removed from the apartment. She went to the hospital afterwards. 

She claimed many times that this was the first time something like this happened. I really doubt that, because she kept saying things like ""I really tried"" a lot. I think this was just the breaking point for her. I don't think it had ever been this bad. She said she saw a chance to run, and was thankful we were home and answered the door. 

I am still in shock at this point, and it is 7 1/2 hours after she knocked on the door. I tried to go down and check on her this morning, but no one answered, and I didn't hear any noise from the apartment. I am sure she is still at the hospital. So my question is, what else can I do to help her? We are about to have a bad storm later this afternoon which will continue through the weekend. I want to invite her up if she needs someone to talk to, or has a hard time cooking or anything due to her hand. But is there anything more I can do? I also feel bad because I know she has a little dog. I am not sure how long she will be gone, and don't want the dog to be alone in the apartment with no food and nowhere to go to the bathroom. I have tried to see if the back door was unlocked, since we have a fenced back yard and I am the only other person with access, but it wasn't. If I do manage to get in somehow, would it be wrong to bring the dog upstairs and take care of her until the neighbor gets home?

They aren't living together and haven't been for over a year but they're still legally married. She contacted me today explaining that he had shown up at her work and verbally assaulted her in front of her employees and that she's ready to do whatever has to be done to get him out of her life.

She fears for her safety and her life as he has beaten her on multiple occasions; one of which she ended up going to the doctors where he basically demanded she file a police report after she tried to say that she fell.  She didn't file the report. I know there have been numerous other altercations that she hasn't told me about but I've seen the bruises.

What is next? I plan on contacting an abuse counselor for her to talk to her and get her in the right direction. How hard is it to get a restraining order? What do they actually do? She has said that if she gets one that i need to get one - even though i have never met him he is aware of me and has stated that he if she tries anything i will be the first person he comes after.

2ufkaa,"[Help] / [Rant] Is this dissociation/anxiety or something else? Also some more stuff. Hi, just want to see if there's anyone else that experiences something similar and if there are any things that can help.

I've got an initial therapy appt in March, but I do have to make it through till then.

I've been having these little ""episodes"" since about my sophomore year in college. I was experimenting with drugs a lot, and I think those were definitely a trigger. They got bad around that time then subsided. They've come back in full force.  The episodes are hard to describe- I suddenly get this far-away feeling or suddenly become aware that my body is moving automatically/that I'm not really controlling my body. I continue as normal to the outside world- I continue pretty much exactly what I was already doing, I just suddenly feel really really weird about it. I have sudden thoughts like ""I'm alive right now"" and I feel like my perspective and vision change very subtly. It's really uncomfortable. I also start to feel like I can't control my body, or that it's moving without my own input. Is this sort of thing what ""dissociation"" is, or does it sound like something different?

I also am thinking about asking to get tested for ADHD. I've been reading some things about it recently and it's become a little eerie how much it sounds like me. But really, reading about lots of different disorders makes me go ""oh, totally me."" 

I'm also having a lot of skin picking problems. I stopped biting my nails (4th or 5th attempt) and now all that energy has transmuted into picking out spots on my scalp, compulsively eating scabs, etc. 

I think some but not all of this is exacerbated by the job I started about half a year ago- I'm noticing a lot more crying outbursts and procrastination. I've got a lot of anxiety surrounding social situations, and it requires me to talk to people all day. And I know what classist connotations this might show, but a lot of the people I have to contact daily are very impoverished and have had poor education- most are legitimately really hard to talk to. I have to get specific information from them and a lot of them just don't want to talk to me or can't/don't want to articulate the information I need, even though I'm the person who can help them get something they may need.  There's also an expectation of high productivity at my job, which requires compartmentalizing these people as numbers. I need to stick with it for now because I have a very poor job history.  Not to mention that jobsearching is even a little more uncomfortable than my job.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I just kinda needed to word vomit.

22p1al,"I do not know what to do anymore. I am sorry. i am sorry, first off, let me just say that. because i'm not sure if i should be allowed to share this story. for all i know, i may be an abuser, i may be an awful person. but i don't know what else to do.

around six years ago, my cousin and i were playing a game, he added a rule, if i lost the game, i would have to kiss his, ""willy"" as he said. now, my cousin has always been a really aggressive and violent person, the first time i met him he told he would get his dad to kill me if i upset him, and out of fear, i went along with it and i, kissed his ""willy"".

after that, we both moved on to, experimenting. it never went past grinding up against one another, and neither of us were aroused by it. but, the experimentation happened at least twice, however, instead of out of fear, the experimentation just happened, we both agreed to it, and it happened. we haven't seen each other since, and from what i've heard my cousin is still as aggressive as ever.

but here's where i'm not sure anymore. i was 11 when this happened, and he was 8. i don't know anymore, i don't know what to think, i don't know what to think about what happened. am i the abuser here? should i hand myself into the police? i don't know what to do anymore. 

i talked to ""Bravehearts.org"" a site geared towards talking about child sex abuse, and they told me that kids experiment, it happens, and that i am allowed to forgive myself for what happened and more on with my life, but i don't know what to do anymore. this has been haunting me ever since, i feel like a monster and i'm not sure whether or not i deserve to feel like this.

2wm0n8,"Thing with a friend got messed up. So there is this girl that I was friends with in high school, we didn't talk much. So basically she started going to the same university as me and we started talking. She told me she flirted with me all of high school and that I showed no interest. Anyways somehow we ended up talking about sex blah blah and we both want to have sex with each other. So I kinda led her on for about two weeks, and at the beginning of this she said that she didn't just fuck around, which is weird because she is in a relationship and us having sex would mean he cheating. Actually given some of the things we have said to each other I would consider that she has already cheated, although not physically. Along the way I hinted strongly that I wasn't interest in her emotionally and that I was not looking for a relationship. Eventually I told it to her flat out and she got upset, saying that ""she's not just a piece of meat"". I guess I set it up so that she would get pissed at me and not sleep with me. I'm a virgin and I think she expects that I would develop feelings for her as a result of sex. I said ""If you wanted sex and friendship but nothing more, then why would you be mad for me saying I wouldn't give anything more?"" She said ""That's not how sex works. We both know it. Plus who said that's what I wanted. I was saying I knew where YOU stood. And for me that's not okay. Because I'm worth everything and more than that."" and ""Like if it happened it happened but to just come out and say it? You're an asshole."". I feel like she is mad because I said I don't want to develop feelings for her and I was to keep it strictly physical.

2up2sx,"Should we approach a fellow colleague about their offensive body odor? My college classmates and I are becoming increasingly agitated over a fellow colleague's pungent body odor. I know this sounds immature and shallow, but the smell is distracting and nauseating, to the point I have to hold my breath. We are healthcare students and have strict regulations as it is regarding hygiene, b.o. and cigarette smoke ect, so the patients are being exposed to this as well. 

I would like to give this person the benefit of the doubt, perhaps it's the result of a medical condition, but it doesn't outweigh the fact that there is no apparent attempt on their part to mask the odor. If I had to describe it, I would say it smells like this person never showers, is wearing dirty clothes and underwear, sour dish towel, and a mix of armpit b.o. and layers of pungent dried bodily secretions. Normally this wouldn't bother me, however this person is constantly in my close vicinity and I can literally taste it in my mouth. It's starting to really irritate me and violate my personal space.

Other people have made comments but not directly toward her, just in front of her, they also reported her to instructors and apparently she was talked to....but se continues to come to class and clinical with the same overwhelming odor. 


Should someone say something directly to her? I've researched body odors and truly cannot attribute it to anything that fits the description, but regardless I don't want to offend a potential disorder. Do I have the right to be assertive about my personal space or should I suck it up and just avoid her as much as possible (hard)? Please help!

I just moved to another country looking for a job, my friend offered me to stay at his place, he's doing great financially and is considered to be rich. He's been really generous to me.. I mean every time we go out he'd pay for pretty much everything he wouldn't let me pay! It felt good at the beginning.. And I felt loved and all but he acts weird at times..

About this life sounds weird.. I know.
Not only that, yesterday he changed his tone when he talks to me and suddenly he decided that.. I should ""praise"" him for doing all of these things for me, he made it sound like I'm unappreciative for all of the things he did to me...

I just started a blog for work (I work for a domestic violence agency) and while we've already brainstormed some ideas for the blog, I want to get as much input from other women and DV survivors as to what topics would be of interest to them. Some examples of what we have lined up for future posts:

* Healthcare Resources-- general re-enrollment information, special enrollment/exceptions for DV survivors, etc.
* Economic Empowerment--financial literacy info, job search tips, keeping your workplace safe from abuser, etc.
* Sexual Assault resources &amp; info
* Youth dating violence resources &amp; info
* LGBTQ DV resources &amp; info
* Immigration &amp; DV resources
* Housing DV rights &amp; info
* Workplace DV rights &amp; info
* Child &amp; Youth services &amp; resources
* Restraining order process, police involvement, victim rights, civil law suits etc.
* How to support peers/family members/friends going through DV


Please feel free to share anything else that you would want to hear about or as a survivor would have liked to have known from the beginning. My list is very general and short compared to what we've brainstormed, but please expand on any of them so I can make sure we touch on all those detailed topics and are going in the right direction.

They've been friends since they were kids, and when they were both homeless she had nowhere else to go.

But she claims she's tried to tell the police and they didn't listen, and that there's nothing she can do to make him stop.

How can I make him face consequences when what he does is less outright violent and more just. well, being fucking horrible?

2g9vvd,"Stuck Hi,

I'm 28 and tonight my boyfriend punched me so hard that I have a gash near my eye, I probably should go to the hospital (and get stitches) but I'm scared / have many excuses / he hates my cat and i'm scared he will hurt or kill her or let her out on purpose / don't have a ride back etc so I put normal bandages on the wound. This isn't the first time something like this happened but it's been a long time since the last time. He went to DV classes and things seemed fine, I guess not.

I'm stuck because I don't have any friends, unless you count people whose real names I don't know from world of warcraft. 

He's here without papers from Japan and that's the reason I took him back last time plus the LAPD told me he's got every right to live here even if he's not on the lease and even if this happens. He's got literally nowhere to go. He hasn't a job, I am now in the same boat but was stupidly supporting him for a year. I am the only one on this lease but all the furniture are his and my cat who he hates lives here.

I understand I am an idiot. I've attended the required 50+ hours of DV classes for women in this sort of situation and yet I am sitting here. There was so much blood tonight and he freaked out, got me a towel then showered just so in his words, ""I'm not going to jail smelling again"". If I had the money or means, I *think* I would leave. I know there are shelters but my cat is my life and I cannot leave her behind and I have literally no one in my life except for him.

1kvbhk,"21 Steps to Human Hello, everyone!

So I was abused for a while, and I've never really dealt with it. I've gone to therapy before a few times, but they always wanted to talk about what was going on now. One therapist cried when I told her my history. Another told me that it was incredible I was alive. This was obviously not super useful to me, so I stopped trying. But recently, the fact that I can't connect to people enough to trust them or to really believe on any sort of profound level that I'm loved has really started to seem like a big problem. I need to let someone in. A friend or my aunt or, god-forbid, maybe even a significant other. Just someone. So I joined a support group. I've only been to two meetings so far, and the process is really new to me, but I'm hopeful for the first time that surrounded by people who know exactly what I'm going through I might actually be able to go through it. After the first meeting, I was so overwhelmed by so many thoughts, and I realized how relatable all of these thoughts might be to other people who have been afraid to seek help for years. So I started a blog. I'll be updating with my experience of the recovery process (for lack of a better phrase). If you think you might find it helpful or are curious at all, here is the link: http://21stepstohuman.tumblr.com/

2ohq54,"I'm scared one day I will kill somebody I'm genuine about this. I'm 30 year old male, and I've suffered depression, anxiety, and anger outbursts all my life.

I've been able to control myself over the years, I usually go out for a walk, or go sit alone, or read a book. Just anything to calm me down. Because I've learnt over the years how to do this.

Recently I went through a horrible depression patch. I tried to kill myself, and ended up in a bad way. Was put on meds, which worked, then taken off them because their apparently addictive. Since then. the anger has been unbearable.

Since they took me off those meds some 6 months ago.

Now, even a tiny thing can cause me to snap. Like, my dad was supposed to drop some money to my house that he owed. Then I learn he passed my house and didn't even stop. No idea why. But then when he got home he said ""Might pop down later, just busy"".

My head was buzzing, literally. I couldn't focus my eyes. It felt like I zoned out. I got so angry I wanted to smash up my house.

Tiny things make me snap.

It's the zoning out that scares me now because I feel like I lose control. Just I had to force myself to do like 50 pressups to try and make myself stop. Which worked a little.

I'm just scared that these will continue and one day I will kill someone. I have to stop myself getting aggressive towards people. I've lost it in a super market before with people because they walk too slow infront off me (and got banned from the supermarket because of my actions).

I really do not want to feel this way. When I'm happy, I am over the moon. I do a lot of charity and fundraising work, with a real passion for it. So it's not as if I have no care for people, because I do. I just do not understand why at times I am made to feel like this.

Feels like I'm two different people.

Please, I need some advice. I've got a psychiatrist, for my mental health, but they are no help at all.

In high school I was molested by a drunk friend of my sister's and raped by a boyfriend. I was also abused by another boyfriend. Since then I have been cornered and assaulted a few other times by separate people. But most recently, I was in a relationship that was emotionally abusive. He would tell me he loved me and he was dying without me every time I tried to leave, but when I was with him he repeatedly slept with another girl, told me it was my fault and intentionally made me feel like crap about myself. He even told me that I was ""just sex,"" which he knew is what my father told me. 

Given this history, I have a lot of trust issues. Really. I often find myself afraid of being alone in a room with a guy. Now, I'm in a relationship with a great guy. He's really sweet to me.

Recently she's been feeling as if one of the other pharmacist, we'll call her Sally (Caucasian) has been getting preferential treatment, on the many job functions they have to perform on a day to day basis. Some of the tasks that are harder to complete have been continuously assigned my GF, and the more preferred tasks have been assigned to Sally on a steady basis. Even though Sally started to work 2 weeks prior, my GF (Non-Caucasian) completed all her training's, and certifications before Sally. It was rumored that Sally had a conversation with the manager, and she asked to only be placed on day shifts moving forward, and through the unfortunate stroke of luck, my GF was put on night shift for every single day in March. Today she finds out that Sally who was previously only put on some preferred duties for March, she was put on that duty for Every Day in March. How do this happen? 

This isn't random and this looks like someones showing preference over someone else. How do you correct this? 

I spoke to my GF, and I relayed to her that it's important she have a conversation with the manager about the responsibilities, shifts she's going to be put to work, and how she's more qualified to be doing such tasks. I relayed to her that she should express how the distributed of shifts work and tasks worked among every one should be even as well. 

I also told her that this is going to be a tough task and she'll have to weather the storm for March and make sure this doesn't happen in April and beyond. She doesn't like having to work there now, and she's feeling like shes being weeded out over the other girl. 

I've tried to think about how we can help the matter but I'm not sure. Please Advise.

2wnzc5,"Can someone help cure my roomie blues? My roommate and I get along really well, and I do consider her a friend. That being said, there are several things about her that I get very annoyed with. We're the same age and in the same stage in our life but I feel a definite gap between my own sense of responsibility and hers. At first I would laugh off her little antics, but it's getting to the point where I cannot even begin to hide my irritability at much of what she does. Some examples: 

Every single day, she says something about how she's going to clean and tidy up and get a bunch of stuff done on her next day off. I don't even listen to her anymore when she says stuff like this, because I will come home after she's been off work all day and she will say something along the lines of ""oh my god I didn't do anything today. I'm so lazy. Why am I so lazy? Motivate me!"" This happens regularly. 

I started doing the dishes the other day (after she said she was going to do them and then just didn't) and she saw me doing them, got annoyed and said ""stop! let me finish them!"" then does dishes for 5 minutes and goes ""I'm the worst. I'll just finish these later.""

She also asks for favors like ""will you wake me up before I have to go to work?"" or will come home after I've done a workout and say ""you worked out without me?!"" And won't tell me when the cable bill is due, claiming ""I've always been so bad about letting people know when they owe me money."" Um...

Everything comes back to her being too tired/lazy/sloth like etc. I'm just getting so sick of it, and I'm not sure how to bring it up without causing a riff in the relationship. I don't care at all if you're not going to clean, but STOP saying you are and then making excuses for why you didn't! It wouldn't be so bad if situations just like the ones above happened once in a while, but it's every freaking day. I'm not claiming to be a perfect roommate in anyway, and I know that this isn't the worst roommate scenario, but I seriously can't figure this girl out, and I'm at a loss for handling future situations like these.

2uspv5,"IDK wtf happened to me over the past few weeks and leading into the last two days Being a recovering alcoholic, I used to have terrible anxiety and depression. Mainly anxiety though. Afraid to leave to the house, afraid to make changes in my life, afraid to pay bills for some reason, circular thought, impending thoughts of doom...the works. I was also prone to a few panic attacks during withdrawals....

Fast forward to 2 and half years sober. I recently had these feelings come back to me. I previously attributed the anxiety to my alcohol use, but it seems it has come back on me. In the past few weeks my normally low stress job has given me anxiety and irrational thoughts. I thought i was dehydrated, or too much caffeine, or something, but i could do nothing to lower it while at work.

Monday, I learned i made a mistake at work, and became extremely paranoid about my action. I started breathing heavy, could feel my heart beat, couldnt sit still etc. My boss was in a meeting until after my scheduled time to leave and left without confronting him. My anxiety about the whole situation got worse as the day turned to night and i slept none. 

In the morning i felt unable to leave my apartment because of it and called in sick (which i never do), my anxiety was still of the charts. Last night i only slept 5 hours and took a vacation day today. Today i feel very tired however my anxiety is much much lower. I feel almost normal, or at least able to think rationally about the situation and see how much i overreacted. 

I followed this thread and didnt feel alone. Crazy, but not alone.

26cl8x,"F/22 Becoming angry and abusive like father--help! I grew up in an emotionally and physically abusive household. My father was controlling, emotionally manipulative and physically abusive while my mother enabled this behavior. It was a very difficult, life-threatening environment. I do not speak to my father anymore and I have removed myself from that environment by taking the step to end my relationship with him.

I had a difficult time coming to terms with the implications of the abuse when I moved out of his home during college. Most of my undergraduate years I spent depressed and engaging in self-harm behaviors.

It took awhile but I realized just how NOT-NORMAL and destructive this behavior was and I was able to make the safest and healthiest choice for me to end my relationship with him. We haven't spoken in two years.

After I overcame the persistent sadness, I was fine--happy or content even. But nowadays I find myself with holding uncomfortable rage that leads to behaviors just like what my father exhibited. I'm mad like 80-90% of the day and I'm becoming quick to fits anger (yelling/breaking things/mild physical violence), emotionally manipulative and MEAN, where people have to walk on eggshells around me --just terrible human being status. I feel like I am reenacting what has been done to me. And because my mom and I live together I feel like I'm forcing her to live with my father again. Instead of hurting myself I imagine physically hurting others (badly) and Its so fucking scary and I'm not sure where to go for resources or support or how others handled this issue. (I am seeking counseling in the near future)

And its not like I'm some scum of the earth person either-- I work with kids, I volunteer, I'm ethically vegan. I have survived abuse and I want to eliminate the aftermath from my life.

Please, I don't need judgement just-- advice or support from people who may have gone through similar experiences...

2u8ivr,"I start a new job on Monday. What's your experience with new jobs like? I found out Wednesday and my heart has been racing ever since. I haven't started a new job in 4 years (was at my old one for 3 years and was VERY comfortable there and the last 8 months I've been in school full time). My anxiety isn't as debilitating as a lot of other posters on here, but everything is running through my mind. It's working at a sheet metal shop, so the apprentice/journeyman relationship/stuff is freaking me out too. I don't want to get bullied or pushed around. I'm going to be standing around with brand new work pants and brand new tools and not knowing shit all and I'm scared I'm going to fuck up or whatever, even though I know it'll be months before I'm trusted with anything important. I know most people are nervous on the first day of school or work (even without anxiety) but I feel like I should be excited. I'm about to start my career (I literally finished my final exam today and start in 3 days). I never even had an interview or have been to the place I'm working, they're so desperate for workers I was just given the Foreman's name an address and a time to show up. I know as soon as I get to know my coworkers and gain their trust I'll make friends and be fine but the start of something new is something I dread every day.

30lmih,"""I'm sorry"" Someone at my son's school taught him to say ""I'm sorry"", and he uses it reflexively without understanding what it means.  He is two years old, so this is no surprise.  We had been using a more empathy based technique of helping him see how his actions effect other people; then we check in with the other child to see if they are okay and find out how we can help.

We still walk him through this process but at school it is ""I'm sorry"", which he doesn't understand.  As a result of something this morning, I am now incorporating language about ""I'm sorry"" into our post-issue discussions:  *""I'm sorry"" means that we feel bad and we made a mistake.*  This was already in the back of my mind as a result of a discussion I had last night.

""I'm sorry"" by itself is not an apology.  It needs to be (1) directed to the person harmed, (2) an acknowledgement of responsibility, (3) sincere.  ""I regret my actions"" is not an apology, it is a self-focused statement of how someone's actions affected themselves, and it can easily be insincere.  A genuine apology *focuses on the person harmed*.

""I am sorry you were hurt"" is not an apology, as is ""I am sorry you feel bad"".  You may feel sorry, but that doesn't mean you have made an actual apology.

Note: Adults may harm others purposefully, and with intent, and in that case the action taken is *not* a mistake.  To say you've made a mistake in that instance *mitigates your acknowledgement of your responsibility* and undermines the apology.",abuse,"['sorry', 'someone', 'son', 'school', 'taught', 'say', 'sorry', 'uses', 'reflexively', 'without', 'understanding', 'means', 'two', 'years', 'old', 'surprise', 'using', 'empathy', 'based', 'technique', 'helping', 'see', 'actions', 'effect', 'people', 'check', 'child', 'see', 'okay', 'find', 'help', 'still', 'walk', 'process', 'school', 'sorry', 'understand', 'result', 'something', 'morning', 'incorporating', 'language', 'sorry', 'post', 'issue', 'discussions', 'sorry', 'means', 'feel', 'bad', 'made', 'mistake', 'already', 'back', 'mind', 'result', 'discussion', 'last', 'night', 'sorry', 'apology', 'needs', 'directed', 'person', 'harmed', 'acknowledgement', 'responsibility', 'sincere', 'regret', 'actions', 'apology', 'self', 'focused', 'statement', 'someone', 'actions', 'affected', 'easily', 'insincere', 'genuine', 'apology', 'focuses', 'person', 'harmed', 'sorry', 'hurt', 'apology', 'sorry', 'feel', 'bad', 'may', 'feel', 'sorry', 'mean', 'made', 'actual', 'apology', 'note', 'adults', 'may', 'harm', 'others', 'purposefully', 'intent', 'case', 'action', 'taken', 'mistake', 'say', 'made', 'mistake', 'instance', 'mitigates', 'acknowledgement', 'responsibility', 'undermines', 'apology']"
140s5p,"Dealing With My 32 Year Old Brother. Throw away due to paranoia.  Also, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit the criteria.

So, some back story.  I'm 19 and my brother is 32. When I was a kid, he was extremely emotionally abusive to me, as well as emotionally and physically abusive to my Mother.  He is also a shut-in, has no job, and will steal from family members.  He is also a diagnosed sociopath. My mother always tells me that when she dies, I will have to take care of him and provide a home for him. 

I don't want this, and I feel like I'm locked in this fate.  He is still very emotionally abusive, though he no longer physically abuses my mother because I would definitely fight back. I don't want to have to take care of him, I feel like I will never have a wife or kids, because I'm going to have to take care of this aging child. What woman would want a man who will have that kind of responsibility?  I know I am being a selfish idiot, but I look at my moods all day, and I'm always happier and better when he isn't around.

2wxjqd,"I need advice on what to do with a terrible living situation! Ok, So I'm going to sum this up pretty quick because I'm pressed for time.... I live with 3 guys, and 1 girl extremely close to campus (were students). The girl is a problem. They all have their various problems, but last night she let two ""questionable"" characters come over and one of them subsequently left our apt with my roommates PS4. This morning the other gentlemen (who we didn't know was still there) stole another roommates laptop. 

The problem lies in liability. Let it be known this isn't the first time damages or property theft has occurred to us. Our management seems drastically uninterested in helping us, and I feel trapped... My summer sublease just backed out (and I question if it's management's doing) and I can't live in constant danger and lack of security.

Do I have a strong case? What can I actually threaten? I'm literally counting the days until my laptop, camera, or other expensive tools is stolen from right under my nose with no one to be held accountable. 

My roommates filed a police report today, they spoke with the girl, she claims the gentleman she left in our apt this morning ALONE stole her IPAD. but i think it's a ruse. These cats knew what they were doing, and they did it perfectly. 

I need out of my lease. I need out of this situation. And I'm afraid management is going to just throw their hands up and say oops, too bad, there's not much we can do bullshit.. 

Do I have a case to file a lawsuit? Can I threaten legal counsel or public defamation of the company? 

I feel like I'm going insane and I feel completely VULNERABLE. 

Please Help.

29upxx,"I'm really scared to call the help line. My daughter's father dumped me a few months ago but we still live together because I have no place to go.  I think he also likes having me around in this position because he feels like I deserve everything he says to me since I haven't found a way to get out.  He was abusive before that but I guess it didn't register until I started talking to people online and they told me how seriously fucked up his treatment is.  One of those people had been linking me information about emotional abuse for a while but I guess I didn't want to admit it was happening to me until he finally did something so mean, crazy and hurtful I stopped lying to myself and read every word.  Since then I've started to realize both how abusive he really is and that he's getting progressively worse.  

I've been trying to get a job so I can move out. I've been out of work for the last 3 years raising his daughter from his first marriage after she got taken from her mom by CPS.  Until two weeks ago I couldn't get help with either kid.  I don't have any money, he won't help me with any and I don't have anyone who can even take care of the kids so I can go to an interview.  He recently just gave the older one back to her mom so now it's just me and the toddler but I can't go to interviews with her, either.  I've read about resources to help women in my situation out but I'm so anxious about calling.  

What's going to happen? What are they going to ask me?  Do I need proof?  Is what he's doing bad enough for me to get help?  I don't want someone to take care of me, I just want to be able to get a job and get on my feet again.  I'm so tired of walking on egg shells, of being yelled at, of being told I'm worthless, being treated like I'm less than human and that I deserve this.  I'm sick of feeling helpless.  Can someone please tell me what to expect?  I feel like if had a map for what will happen when I call I won't feel this overwhelming sense that I may just be making things worse. Thanks. 

Edit:  So I ended up using the chat to talk.  It was a really positive talk and the person pointed out a lot of manipulation I hadn't figured out yet.  It's hard to spot what someone's doing to you sometimes from the inside.  They where really nice and I have some resources to look into tomorrow.  I feel way less worried about this and maybe even a little hopeful that I'm near the end of this.

1rgwdq,"A story with hope (potential triggers) Disclaimer:  I have trauma-induced amnesia from this.  Most of this story (before 5 years old) comes out of family testimony and deduction.  The reason I'm sharing this is to share hope. 

My biological mother was confirmed to have neglected me until I was adopted to the age of five.  My father was in the Navy at the time, and was deployed for much of the time (nobody is blaming him, besides for being an idiot for marrying her in the first place.  Even he regrets it now).  It has caused a number of issues throughout my life, including depression, social awkwardness, and even a speech impediment (at five, I talked like a two year old.  This trend continued into my teens).  
I have a record from my state's CPS.  One time, she called an exorcism.  Another, she locked me (remember, I'm a toddler) out of the house for hours because I was crying too much.  
There are no confirmed reports of physical abuse.  However, I have a number of very large scars on my back that I've had all my life.  Too large to not have a memory about.  They're also very clean, as if they came from a knife.  Most of my family and I deduced it came from her.
I have yet to forgive her.  
I was finally rescued from this at the age of 4 or 5.  My dad's sister (My aunt, though I call her Mom) and her adult daughter (I will refer to her as my sister) took me in.  My sister didn't live with us, so it was just me and my Mom.  Even to this day, my Dad and I keep in contact.  I don't blame him whatsoever.  
Before I continue, I want to make the disclaimer that she is long forgiven and I love her a lot.  I lived with her for nearly a decade (from 4-5 years old to 13).  During that time, she developed a gambling addiction.  I became a latchkey child and was alone for what seemed like most nights.  Because of my social awkwardness and poor communication skills, I was constantly bullied throughout school.  I practically had to raise myself.  During this time, my sister got married and had a child.  They moved out of state.  At the end of my time with my Mom, she had ran out of money and was unable to take care of me.  I moved in with my sister and her family.
Imagine a 13 year old going from practically living alone to living with a full family.  My depression got worse and worse, but everyone attributed it to ""teenage angst."" Honestly, I don't think they really knew me and they weren't sure what to think.  Despite this, my life got better.  I gained very close friends and they helped me through.  Of course, High School had its ups and downs.  I was able to manage my depression through the friends that were always there for me.  
I now have a college degree and I'm with a great girl (that I know won't abuse our children).  We've been together for almost four years.  I'm on track to become a police officer.  

The whole point of this is to not be sob story.  I'm over what happened to me and (obviously) free to talk about it.  This isn't even a throwaway.  I went through a lot, and came out just fine.  For all those who think they're forever messed up because of what happened to them, there's always a way to get through and break into a better life.  I still have my scars.  But I've learned to accept them.  I'm a survivor.

** --2012-- **

I get a misdemeanor possession of Marijuana charge in college. I believe that my job prospects from that moment on are null and void.

** --3 Months Ago-- **

My dad sticks his neck out for me to get a job. I pass a technical exam for his company. He signs a contract stating that if I get fired for any reason, he will never be able to leave the company. (He's kind of been their golden goose inventor for a minute).

I get the job. I move. I leave everything behind for a fresh start. Not two days after I move in I meet a girl on Tinder, and we begin hooking up in the interim between my move and my job beginning.

** --Two Weeks After That-- **

Work is going fine, but being an IT Manager is time consuming. My hookup grows increasingly upset that I don't have the time to spend with her, and she begins to interfere with work. I warned her earlier that she should never make me choose between my job and her, and then she does exactly that.

** --The Next 6 Weeks After That-- **

I gain an understanding of just how crazy she is. She stalks me, threatens self harm, and I am forced to involve the police.
Then, she reveals that, despite our mutual use of contraceptive, she is pregnant. Neither of us wants the child, but she believes that keeping it will keep me around. I convince her to terminate it. She then makes an attempt on her life. I remove myself from the situation and get a restraining order.

** --now-- **

The abortion and her suicide attempt are taking their toll on me. I can't just give up. Work is intensifying and i need to keep up with it no matter what but every day i grow more and more listless and incapable of doing even simple tasks.

im cracking up. I think this broke me and i didnt realize it until now. I love kids. i have 3 niblings. and i killed mine.

2vmj0o,"Exasperated with my GF's pet bird, I need a solution (Green Cheeked Conure) Pic: http://www.parrot-and-conure-world.com/images/just-adopted-a-yellowsided-greencheeked-conure-21352347.jpg

I originally liked the bird and we got along just fine. The bird was mildly annoying before because it is super difficult to potty train and poops every 10 minutes where ever it pleases and often on my clothing. The bird also chews on literally everything destroying things about 75% of its waking hours. The bird also will beg at the table and just walk up to your food and take it out of your bowl or off your plate. When it eats, I swear only maybe 20% of the food ends up in his mouth and the rest he literally flings onto the floor by shaking his head.

My gf adores it though and I love her so I could still like the bird for its other qualities. However, now it went through puberty and it became super territorial over my gf and hates me for no reason. Its play biting before was nothing compared to now and he has drawn blood several times now. I don't hold him anymore and I have asked my gf to limit my time with him to specific periods for the sole purpose of bonding. The bird is evil I swear.

At first he tried to attack my face/eyes one day when she woke me up and he bit the bottom of my eyelid, thank god he missed my eye. He tries to fly and attack my face incessantly when I am in the room. He knows now that my gf doesn't like this and he actually watched her go upstairs once and attacked as soon as he saw she was gone. When my gf is there with the bird, I have this this underlying stress about the bird attacking my eyes.

I sometimes where sunglasses when the bird is around to feel safer but it is just getting right to the end of my patience. This girl is like just perfect for me in every way but the bird is very much like her child to her and I am exasperated with it. I have realized that when I think of visiting my gf, my first thought is, ""Oh yay, I get to see her"" but then my second thought is ""Oh I have to see her bird"".

2obg7a,"Anger in my family life. Hello, 

Longtime redditor but I felt I needed to make a new account to address some problematic mental health issues that I have been experiencing, that have gotten worse and worse as I age. I'm in my late twenties. I never had problems with anger as a kid or a teenager. I got married to my wife when I found out she was pregnant with our first. We were both 18 when she got pregnant. After our daughter was born, I started having fits of anger. I found that I would become extremely annoyed if she would misbehave, or spill something, or ruin something of mine, things like that. At one point, I nearly slapped her because she wouldn't stop crying when I was playing a video game. Let me stop at that last point. I realize that that statement is reprehensible at best. I know now how selfish and cruel I have to be to be in that mindset. It is a regret that I carry with me all the time. I have made it a point to work through this selfish behavior, and to allow myself to show love to my children (I have two more now, a boy who is now 6 and a little girl who is a year and a half), but I still experience episodes of impatience and anger when the littlest thing goes wrong. I feel that I provide love and support to my wife and children, but it hurts them when they see that I'm angry. It's not their fault, yet I still let every thing get to me. My son has started to act out against me and his mom, and I just want things to change. I don't know how to do it.

2uzy4r,"Anxiety caused by modern technological living, and the general current state of global affairs Does anybody else have this issue? 

Now that I have started to battle this anxiety rather than just allow it to dictate my life, I am gaining some deeper insight into how I got this way.

I used to never be able to even begin to point to even one possible source of my anxiety, but now its becoming a bit clearer that what brings me the most anxiety is the unstoppable advancement of technology and its unforeseen (and seemingly completely neglected) consequences on human values and social interaction as a whole.

I have spent the past couple days hanging out with old friends for the first time in years and realize that my problem isn't that I don't like interacting with people, or even have trouble with it, but in fact is that the entire game of social interaction has changed for the worse. 

It is the day to day interaction with strangers (what used to be called your ""community"") which gives me anxiety. 

For example: 

When I am in public waiting in line, or waiting anywhere, I become anxious that there is absolutely 0 interaction. People are staring at their devices, and I feel like the crazy or suspicious one if I am not doing the same. When I pass somebody on the street and say hello or offer a smile, i cringe as they walk past unresponsive or miserable looking imagining how crazy I must seem to them.

2tlss2,"[Rant] Attacks, thinking too much, yo-yoing into depression and back to normal Something has to be seriously wrong with me. About November-2014 I've been panicky and paranoid about a lot of things. Sometimes I really question whether my friends even like me or want me around, especially some of the things I say out of the blue.

Skype notifications/phone ringtones scare the shit out of me sometimes, even if they were just normal chit-chat. People taking a long to write a message make me panic too. Hell, panic attacks are very VERY common for me. 2 a day is not out of the ordinary for me. They aren't apparent externally, but I do really feel it when they happen.

Among these attacks, thinking about these things I've done and generally beleiving I'm a worthless human being I've yo-yo'd in and out of depression and guilt. My friends assure me I've done nothing wrong, but I still can't shake that feeling.

My girlfriend, who is the most caring person I've met along with one other person. Left for America at the start of Christmas. She tells me time and time again that she'll be coming back in a week's time, but I can't seem to prove it to myself that she still loves me/hasn't left me for someone else/chosen to stay with her Dad, despite it being a legal impossibility.

I've broken down and panicked/cried in front of my family twice.

Among all these, my friends have been picking up jobs around the area very easily. My gf and I got into a (thankfully not breakup-worthy) argument about her getting work at her grandparent's inn, while I have been sending resumes left and right and hearing nothing back. My friends then end up going out to movies and such, When they do take me they pay for some things of mine but I feel absolutely awful despite them insisting they want to do it for me.

I'm 16, 17 in a week's time (Birthday is on February 1st, same day my girlfriend returns), male, and Australian. I'm heading to college this year, but I seriously don't know what's caused me to be this way. I know I say things out of line sometimes, but I've never been walled by guilt or overthinking until about now.

I would link chatlogs, but I won't out of decency. My friends are wonderful people trying to help me through this, but why can't I convince myself their words are true? and that I'm worth a life on this Earth?

The actually classwork is all online, so there are no lectures in class. Ever. We are not allowed to use technology (""because it is distracting""), nor are we allowed to do other work. Just to be clear, I have no problem with such policies in a class where we ACTUALLY DO WORK; in this class, we do almost no work whatsoever - not almost no homework, but almost no classwork, lectures, discussion.

We do nothing at all for the first 15 minutes of class (don't ask me why), we just sit in silence while the professor does... whatever it is that she does. The rest of the class is not much better. She slowly speaks maybe a sentence or two and then pauses for like a minute before saying or doing anything else. Every once in a while she will ask a question about what she was talking about; they are all personal opinion sorts of questions, so most of the time one or two people will answer, and after that she spends 3-4 minutes waiting in case someone else speaks up. Basically, the things we spend 50 minutes doing could easily be condensed to 10 minutes of material by removing all the time we spend sitting there doing nothing.

I am sure some people will say ""just don't go to class."" Unfortunately, missing more than 4 days of class (for ANY reason; even illness) will get your final grade docked one or more letter grades. If you miss more than 9 days of class, you fail it automatically, even if you got all of the online work done and aced every test. So skipping class is absolutely not an option.

I just need some advice on how to keep myself entertained during class. Are there any games I could play with myself with just pen and paper? I don't want to get in trouble or disrupt the class, so it has to be subtle and unobtrusive; something that looks like I am taking notes unless she actually comes up and looks over my shoulder. 

tl;dr - Super boring class - not because the content is boring, but because there is no content. Technology is not allowed. Working on other classwork is not allowed. I need something to do without the teacher noticing to keep myself entertained.

2l4jh1,"The Scary Ease of Revictimization My first marriage was when I was eighteen.  The abuse began when I was nineteen three months after our daughter was born.  The marriage lasted for seven years.  The final nail in the coffin, so to speak, was when he almost killed me in front of my kids.

My second serious relationship went for almost a year with no incident.  Yes, there were some really bad fights, some shoving, but mostly name calling.  One night, he had one drink to many and I ended up showing up at my ""big brother's"" house covered in blood.  I fought back this time, more than I ever did with my first abuser.

Point being, once you become so accustomed to being abused, it's way to easy to fall back into it.  While I was at my big brother's house, he took my car keys....I told him to.  He refused to let me answer my phone when my ex called.....again, my request.  Why?  I wanted to go back to him.  I was already coming up with the old excuses I would come up with for my ex husband.  

The cycle that domestic violence starts....as hard as it is for me to say....it seems to be more addictive than cigarettes.  It's almost like it becomes this....security blanket only instead of a nice fluffy, warm, snuggle item you have this live grenade with a faulty pin that causes it to go off at any given time.  

Ever heard the song ""I Miss the Misery""?  Yea, that pretty well describes it.  I can't help but reminiscing on both my abusers...then I remember what they did to me.  I've been to therapy, I have anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medications, a solid support system of friends, and a safe man that I'm with now.  I find myself, when I'm talking with my current boyfriend, bracing for that fight that will end in me nursing bruises or a busted lip...and in some scary form...almost a form of wanting it to happen.  

Is this how ex meth, coke, heroine, pill poppers, any drug addict feels when they are trying to stay clean?

I never want to be a victim again.  I'm a survivor, and I always will be.  No man will ever hit me again and not pay for it the first time it happens.

But it feels so....familiar.

But its not right, it's not safe, and it's not healthy.

Again, we come back to the security blanket comparison.  You think you're holding onto this warm, fuzzy thing....then it explodes in your face while you're snuggling it.

If the cycle can be started, it can be stopped, but damn it's hard.

2wngut,"Am I selfish for wanting to buy a class ring? So I graduate my masters program in a week, pending the passing of the class I am in currently (which I currently have a B grade in) and by March 1st my college can officially verify that I hold a Masters in Business Administration with a Concentration in Security Management to anyone who asks.   

I am proud of my academic achievements and I really like the symbolism and significance of a class ring that is warn by college graduates, but my current hang up is: I am broke, and currently in a rather long process of getting security clearance for a government job and so I am not sure how long it will be until my first check comes, if it will even come from this source should I somehow fail the security check.     The ring, in the size and style that I was looking at would run about 750 dollars, and would be classy but not showy. I would want to wear it when I walk up on stage and receive my diploma, I remember when I did that with my high school graduation ring and felt rather proud doing it.  Right now I have about 4K in savings as an emergency fund / pile of money under the bed, that has been slowly dwindling due to things like bills, food, and other practical expenses, I feel that this may be one of those occasions when you swear out loud and sign the check because its one of those occasions in life that is a true milestone that is to be celebrated. If I had a job presently I would buy it in a heartbeat but as it stands, I am worried that my desire to commemorate my academic success has blinded me from practical matters, such as keeping enough money in the bank for food, or to pay for a bandaid or two, should I fall down the stairs tomorrow and break something. 

What are your thoughts on this fellow redditors? Am I being selfish for wanting to get a class ring? should I just say screw it and buy it right now? or keep the money  for food and just get it out of my head that I can't afford such lavish items in my current economic state?

After graduating very early (at the age of 20) I moved back into my mother's house and have been living with her for over a year.

2bil1q,"I was sexually abused starting from the age of 11 until 18, and I'm only starting to realize the effects of it 2 years later. How do I start the healing process? Basically, I didn't tell anyone about the abuse while it was happening. It was a secret I kept to myself for a couple reasons. One, I didn't want my family to know because they would be upset about this. Growing up my family had money problems, and I didn't want to tell anyone because this would just stress them out more. Two, my family was dependent on my abuser's family because we lived with them. I thought if I told, we'd be homeless. Three, a small part of me thought everyone would side with him or wouldn't believe me. 

So basically, I thought by not telling everyone, I could protect my family from negativity and homelessness. I thought I could just take all the shots, so to speak, because even though I lose, everyone else would be okay. But now I realize I've lost in a big way. My self esteem and self worth are non existent, and clearly I don't know how to love myself if I think hiding abuse was a good idea. There's so much wrong with me, I dont know where to start.

2pxfgn,I can't deal anymore I'm at the point where I feel the only thing I am good for is to be abused. As a small girl I was told by my mother that I was a mistake and nothing good come will ever come from my existence.  By the time I was 10 I was being sexually abused by my older brother. I was told then it's my fault and I would just have to deal with it. So for 5 years I lived with being violated by him. My room was next to my mother's and she would hear me crying for him to stop. My escape came in the form of a drunk who abused me even worse. That's is when the hitting started plus the rapes. After 10 years I got out of that just to end up with a drug addict. Needless to say over the years the abuse just got worse and worse. There are scars all over my arms and legs cause if no one is abusing me I have to abuse myself. I've been in and out of therapy for years. Now here I am a grown woman with kids who can't be with anyone unless they hit me or treat me like I'm nothing. I'm so tired of feeling like damaged goods. I know no one will ever really love me. I can't let any one in enough to even try to help me heal. Days like today I wish my mother would have aborted me like she wanted. I see no point in even trying anymore. I was only born to be abused used and discarded like yesterday's trash. ,abuse,"['deal', 'anymore', 'point', 'feel', 'thing', 'good', 'abused', 'small', 'girl', 'told', 'mother', 'mistake', 'nothing', 'good', 'come', 'ever', 'come', 'existence', 'time', 'sexually', 'abused', 'older', 'brother', 'told', 'fault', 'would', 'deal', 'years', 'lived', 'violated', 'room', 'next', 'mother', 'would', 'hear', 'crying', 'stop', 'escape', 'came', 'form', 'drunk', 'abused', 'even', 'worse', 'hitting', 'started', 'plus', 'rapes', 'years', 'got', 'end', 'drug', 'addict', 'needless', 'say', 'years', 'abuse', 'got', 'worse', 'worse', 'scars', 'arms', 'legs', 'cause', 'one', 'abusing', 'abuse', 'therapy', 'years', 'grown', 'woman', 'kids', 'anyone', 'unless', 'hit', 'treat', 'like', 'nothing', 'tired', 'feeling', 'like', 'damaged', 'goods', 'know', 'one', 'ever', 'really', 'love', 'let', 'one', 'enough', 'even', 'try', 'help', 'heal', 'days', 'like', 'today', 'wish', 'mother', 'would', 'aborted', 'like', 'wanted', 'see', 'point', 'even', 'trying', 'anymore', 'born', 'abused', 'used', 'discarded', 'like', 'yesterday', 'trash']"
2wxik2,"Anxiety About Whether or Not I Have Anxiety [Help] This has been a continuous conflict in my mind that for some reason I don't seem to be able to resolve. Back and forth in my mind I often banter about whether or not I have severe enough anxiety that I would benefit from anxiety medicine. The anxiety I feel is not so back breaking that I cannot leave my house or function, but I find my self nervous about social situations and often I find myself thinking too much which results in indecisiveness and hesitation. I have a terrible habit of picking at my cuticles around my finger nails when I am nervous, which has resulted in my fingers being permanently scarred and calloused. This habit in itself has convinced me that my anxiety may be more severe than I thought. I have also had a four or five panic attacks where I felt an impending doom and uncontrollable shaking and breathing, but these panic attacks have been spread over months and I don't consider them to be all too frequent. 
Even after considering this evidence I still am unsure whether or not I am just being dramatic and am making what is only mild anxiety into a much bigger deal than it has to be. Sometimes I think I am just being ridiculous and am fishing for something to be wrong with me. Ironically I feel anxiety about whether or not I have anxiety. What always brings me back to this issue is the idea that maybe I am missing out on a world without anxiety by not accepting I am anxious. I have never gone to a doctor to discuss any of this, which is probably what I should do, but I am interested to hear what your opinion is on this. Too often I feel that doctors slap a label on people and feed them medicine without really checking to see if the person actually does have a disorder. Could it be true that maybe my anxiety could be defeated without medicine and that taking meds could be a cop out? Or am I just prolonging anxious misery by not going to a doctor?",non_abuse,"['anxiety', 'whether', 'anxiety', 'help', 'continuous', 'conflict', 'mind', 'reason', 'seem', 'able', 'resolve', 'back', 'forth', 'mind', 'often', 'banter', 'whether', 'severe', 'enough', 'anxiety', 'would', 'benefit', 'anxiety', 'medicine', 'anxiety', 'feel', 'back', 'breaking', 'leave', 'house', 'function', 'find', 'self', 'nervous', 'social', 'situations', 'often', 'find', 'thinking', 'much', 'results', 'indecisiveness', 'hesitation', 'terrible', 'habit', 'picking', 'cuticles', 'around', 'finger', 'nails', 'nervous', 'resulted', 'fingers', 'permanently', 'scarred', 'calloused', 'habit', 'convinced', 'anxiety', 'may', 'severe', 'thought', 'also', 'four', 'five', 'panic', 'attacks', 'felt', 'impending', 'doom', 'uncontrollable', 'shaking', 'breathing', 'panic', 'attacks', 'spread', 'months', 'consider', 'frequent', 'even', 'considering', 'evidence', 'still', 'unsure', 'whether', 'dramatic', 'making', 'mild', 'anxiety', 'much', 'bigger', 'deal', 'sometimes', 'think', 'ridiculous', 'fishing', 'something', 'wrong', 'ironically', 'feel', 'anxiety', 'whether', 'anxiety', 'always', 'brings', 'back', 'issue', 'idea', 'maybe', 'missing', 'world', 'without', 'anxiety', 'accepting', 'anxious', 'never', 'gone', 'doctor', 'discuss', 'probably', 'interested', 'hear', 'opinion', 'often', 'feel', 'doctors', 'slap', 'label', 'people', 'feed', 'medicine', 'without', 'really', 'checking', 'see', 'person', 'actually', 'disorder', 'could', 'true', 'maybe', 'anxiety', 'could', 'defeated', 'without', 'medicine', 'taking', 'meds', 'could', 'cop', 'prolonging', 'anxious', 'misery', 'going', 'doctor']"

2uxmix,"Should I start my life over? I'm not sure where to actually begin so I'm just going to dive right into it. Hopefully you folks can follow along. I'll try to be as clear as possible.

For the past 5 years now I have been having an online relationship with someone I met through a social platform. We've been talking with each other for over the years. In time we became so attached to each other. We've been on webcam together, talked together through Skype and phone all the time. He has helped me through financial issues and prevented me form committing suicide over several times. I can tell him anything and he still thinks the best of me. He does whatever he can to make me happy even though we have yet to meet physically. 

Well that is about to change in a week now. In a week he is planning on visiting me for a week. We've both planned to take vacation time to spend time with each other in person. I'm excited and nervous at the same time and I know he feels the exact same way. We live several states apart. So him coming to see me is a big deal. 

The thing is. We are gay. His family has openly accepted him and treats him just the same. In fact his family knows all about me and I've spoken with them before and they are anxious to meet me soon. However I'm not so fortunate. My family is very religious and homophobic. I never came out to them. I'm terrified of coming out to them. I know the fall out will be catastrophic and I don't think I can mentally prepare for that. If I do come out I would be disowned and thrown out on my head. I'm currently not financially stable to support myself. Plus battling depression internally makes it nearly impossible for me to function in social settings for extreme periods of times.

He has bought a house and has fairly stable job. He wants me to spend this week with him and see how it goes. If the feeling is right, he wants me to come back and live with him. He has taken so much time and care for me from a distance and we love each other a lot. I can't imagine being with anyone else. 

My question is. Should I go? Should I start my life over with him? I've been raised in this religious environment for years and I feel like I'm going to do something terrible if I do leave.

I'm a young girl living with my sister in a rooming house in the awesome city of Silver Spring, Maryland and today I was having a great day today until Jordan, one of the roommates in the house came and addressed my sister and I about how we told the landlord of his strong Marijuana use and how it affects our asthma and COPD illnesses and how it gives us constant headaches and makes us high. 


So this roommate came downstairs and just was being a total smart alec and just said what I felt was a insult by saying how he works everyday and how *he* has a job and a life the *he* lives and to me it sounded like he was symbolically implying that my sister and I don't work or have lives and my sister and I are both teachers (and I'm a filmmaker as well) and we work every day and have a pretty good life. 


Then this guy lied straight to our faces today and said we were confrontational to him during our talk with him today when we weren't, we were calm and we talked to him politely. But he was just lying and being a smart alec and was disrespectful to us and it really took me by shock because when this guy moved in, I thought ""oh wow, we've got a cool, really smart, nice kid here"" but today's incident with this guy just totally made me angry, hurt my feelings and changed my perception of him.

2xodkg,"Dealing with not the best employer, no other options for now. So I started this part-time job as a Medical Assistant in September 2014. Sent in application, got an interview, and was offered the job on the spot. I have no clinical experience, so I thought I was offered the job off of the successful interview. 

My initial pay was $9.00, which seemed reasonable as I have no experience. I was told after my 90-day training period my pay would go up to $11.00/hr, which I was excited about! Fast-forward to month 5, I have still received no raise. I questioned my pay to my ""supervisor"", and I was told my work should be far superior than it is, and that my pay is based off of work performance. I would understand this if this is what I was told from the beginning, but I was told it will go from training pay. Ok, I will take my .50 cent raise.

As I have been working, I have heard more about this company. That they require raise requests to go through the main owner, who does not work directly with 80% of his employers, and they are never fulfilled. Girls who have worked there for 2+ years are making less than a discount food store worker. 

That our supervisor moves employees around multiple offices once they receive word that we have begun working ""like a team"".

My ""training"" consisted of following different workers in different offices who are not trained to train new employees. No ""training"" is held, basically I was told this is how you do this with no reasoning. Meanwhile, I am told different things by different employees which results in myself getting something wrong and getting yelled at by someone. Training to give immunizations, for example. I was given a 15 minute training session and the next day was giving immunizations to patients the next day. I felt comfortable, but girls in my position who may not be comfortable yet are sent to immunize patients with no other option. Blood draws are the same issue. Patients are not aware of the training process either. Ok, I will train myself and this is what I have done. 

The company makes the medical assistants answer phone triage, an email triage, and all of the medical assistant work that is expected with no pay raise. For example, an email traige was just put into place for patients and we are all expected to answer them. They have employees with no experience in the field answering patient questions. They have ultrasound techs giving immunizations and answering phone triage when a medical assistant is not able to.

On top of all of this, I am now required to commute 2 hours to an office to work a half day, where my take home pay will be $5-7 for my 8 hour day, due to staffing issues. I voiced my concern and was told I should expect to travel and that due to scheduling issues I am required at the office.

Sorry for the rant, but these are just a few examples of how this company is run. I am currently applying for positions, but until I hear back and have a job put in place I will have to work here. I just need someone to confirm that I am not the only one that thinks this company is poorly run.

1x6x8n,"""My business will be shoving that phone up your ass if you don't get off the fucking phone!!!!!!!!!!"" On the commute this morning, we're getting much needed rain in San Francisco.  I left my motorcycle at home and took the car, settling in for 20-30 minute drive across town with coffee and NPR.  No biggie.

I can see the douchebag in the Mercedes in front of me leaned over to the right as is standard for the ""I'm driving comfortably while chatting to no one in particular, in flagrant opposition to the law, safety, and common sense."" position.  I understand in some states or regions this insane and obviously dangerous entitled practice is not yet illegal, but then again, I don't understand that at all.  Only another several dozen people will have to die, but at least those phone calls will be made or facebook statuses updated, or LOL texts will be sent.  At least the world can rest on that.

So I do the right/safe/common sense/legal thing, and back off, giving him enough room to hang himself.  

Sure enough, not 5 seconds after I notice this, he nearly rear ends the car in front of him, swerving into the lane to his right to avoid causing an accident. Luckily no one was in the lane to his right.  Luckily *I* was not in the lane to his right.

I lose control.  Mostly.

I lay on the horn, pull up next to him until he rolls down his window, trapped by traffic behind him and the red light and cars in front.

""What?!"" he says indignantly, with his NY Yankee hat and indignant look on his face.

""HANG UP THAT FUCKING PHONE!!!!!!

""Who the fuck are you?!""

""I'M THE GUY USUALLY ON A MOTORCYCLE IN THAT LANE, AND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TAKEN OUT BECAUSE YOU INSIST ON BEING ON THE PHONE.  GET OFF THE FUCKING PHONE!!!!!!!""

""Why don't you just go about your own business?""

""I'M GOING TO MAKE IT MY BUSINESS TO SHOVE THAT FUCKING PHONE UP YOUR ASS IF YOU DON'T GET OFF THE FUCKING PHONE!!!""

""WELL COME ON THEN?!?!""

I thought for a moment about taking him up on his offer, but I'm a yeller not a fighter, so I slowly crept away.  I figured I would leave it up to him to follow me and re engage, and THEN I'd get out of the car and cut his throat, but he didn't, so I didn't.  

I drove in circles letting him get farther ahead in the commute, and continued yelling at no one in particular and pounding my steering wheel until the anger subsided and my hands hurt.

After 20 years of pretty much daily pot smoking, I have to find a new outlet.  I recently got a motorcycle after many years without one, and decided not to smoke and ride this time.  I have a little girl at home, and a wonderful wife.  My life is good and I have no reason to seek the escape I once sought, that became a lifestyle, then became habit.

Problem is, I have no outlet now, save for yelling and posting here.  

I suppose the good news is that while composing this post I've been interrupted several times and already feel better, so maybe it's all over now.  I just fear that my mouth will get me in trouble and I'll either get hurt in a fight, or go to jail.  Neither is acceptable.

OK rant over.  Thanks for providing a cathartic pathway for me to vent, Reddit.

2ihaoi,"I'm not sure how to tell my therapist about being abused. I've been in therapy for a year and feel it's really helped me. I initially started because of an upcoming move and relationship issues that I wanted some help with. I remember early on that my therapist told me we didn't have to talk about things that happened in my childhood, which was a relief to me. I hate talking about it, I have no words and I just want to leave it alone. But I want to be healthy. I used to break down and think about it more frequently when I was younger ( as in high school and early college aged, I'm 24 now), but lately I've noticed I think about it less. And that isn't because I'm trying to suppress it, I think my mind has just been busy working on personal growth, mindfullness and building self confidence ( thanks to therapy) and it really just doesn't come up as much. I just don't want to carry this around with me for the rest of my life. I know I probably won't forget it happened, but I know that it does still affect me. Oddly when I get intense reminders about it I get this phantom throbbing pain in my right wrist. As far as I know I've never injured my wrist and while it's not that physically painful it's kind of distressing in an emotional way. When my wrist starts hurting I know I've been sucked in to memories and am not doing my best. For some time now I've started thinking that maybe when I don't feel pain in my wrist when I think about what happened, that will be one small sign that I've completely healed.

I'm sorry for the length. I guess what I'm trying to find out is how can I tell my therapist (should ?I) about what happened, even if I'm not able to really talk about it. I'm considering writing her a note, but I'm sure that won't be the end of it. Once she finishes reading the note, I don't know what I'll do when she looks up and starts talking about it. I just don't feel I'll be able to say anything.

2vp9ak,"I think I just had a heart attack after drinking a 5 hour drink and red bull. I had my GED test today at 9am, and I didn't get much sleep. So my stupid self thought doing both would help me stay for the day.

After about 4 hours, my heart started beating really fast. It was doing this for an hour. Legs and arms started to feel weird and jaw too.

After an hour, it stopped beating so fast. Legs still feel weird, like kind of stiff but I think it's getting better. I've been drinking lots of water and pee'd quite a few times.

Right now I don't feel my heart beating like it did before, unless I feel it. Seems to be OK. 

My blood pressure, (we have a wrist one) was 127.

I didn't go to ER cause I don't have insurance, nor do I have a ride. If I was sure my heart is failing right now, I'd go but I just can't risk it not being bad and then I got a huge doctors bill.

I know medical advice is frowned upon here, but I'm really hoping someone can tell me if I'm OK and the caffeine is just wearing off. I'm scared right now :(

It also started when I took my anti depressent BuPropion and a another pill that's for my tooth I'm getting pulled in a few weeks. I also took it on an empty stomach. Actually I eat a banana and a piece of bread when it started, and now I'm eating some chili.

What's the chance that my heart is actually failing right now and I might die tonight?

Pretty much everyone in authority disliked me and put me down because if my inattentiveness and I developed a severe problem dealing with people in authority as a result. This has plagued me. 

Work has been a pattern of semi-success and a lot of unrealized potential. I've had many altercations with bosses because I refuse to subordinate myself. I basically quit working for companies a few years ago and I now work for myself. With varying degrees of success. 

I've got a lot of pent up anger from my ADHD experiences and lately I've been finding it harder and harder to contain it. I've started drinking more, which I know is not a good idea, but sometimes it's the only way to cope.

2vdo3l,"Night and day Literally. My feelings when it is night and when it is day are completely different. During the day I feel okay. Not depressed. Not that anxious. Sometimes I get a little bit anxious, but it is so easy to brush it aside, or accept it and get past it. 

But then the night comes. I can feel it. As the day progresses this anxiety just boils up. I takes over and every night I'm stuck almost paralyzed by this anxiety. 

Then the morning comes and I feel great again. I have put off making an appointment or getting help because everyday I think: This is finally over. But then the day progresses and by the night time I am back to where I was the previous night.

I don't think I am depressed. But I have a lot of signs of depression. I don't want to be depressed. But I think somewhere, somehow, deep inside I am depressed. 

I feel so dumb during the morning/afternoon, when I feel almost normal again. I think of how I felt the previous night and it seems so dumb. Yet somehow by the time I go to sleep it is back in full force. I don't understand. My life isn't that bad. I have panic attacks from time to time because I have a fear of being sick. Maybe the stress from that is making me depressed? 

I know I am smart. I have a great girl friend. I don't have many friends, but I am an introvert. I do well in school. I don't have any huge financial problems. I just feel so stupid for having so much anxiety. I know so many people have it worse but I cannot make myself feel better. 

I think maybe my anxiety is finally taking a toll on my ability to cope with stress. I think that it is slowly sucking the energy from me. Some days it is so hard to do anything. My life is crazy. I am 28, I have accomplished a lot of things. Yet I can't seem to overcome this.

Sorry that my writing is scattered. Hard to concentrate. It is a bit late here and the anxiety is getting worse. I don't expect much, I am just venting. It feels good to type. Makes me feel normal.

I was very confident in my skin, I didn't worry at all, I just went on with my business. A few major things happened to me the past few years which I don't consider the catalyst to my anxiety. What I _know_ triggered it was a ""minor"" condition which eventually went away but it made me more aware of my body and different symptoms. I, of course naively, searched through the internet and read lots of different diseases and they kind of stuck into my mind. I started constantly checking myself for any of them. I started noticing my skin and what could be wrong with it. Noticing all the marks, moles and everything that might have been there forever but now they were symptoms. I've had _many_ physical symptoms and I've been to countless doctors only to find that I either have nothing or my condition is banal. Still that didn't assure me that I was OK. I've developed so many psychological conditions that I can't even count. Anxiety, depression, body dysmorphic disorder, somatization disorder, OCD, hypochondria, etc. I know I have them because I'm a rational human being and I know how I used to feel years ago and how I feel now.

Sometimes I see it like it's ridden with diseases and after a few minutes everything looks fine. I've had horrible pains in my armpits that somehow disappeared. I've had pains pretty much everywhere in my body that don't have any logical explanation.

I've had so many checkups and blood tests that I can't even remember. Is there anything I can do to bring my life back to normal, the same was it was a few years ago?

kt928,"What to say to a friend in the early stages of domestic violence? A friend of mine, who lives far away from me, has just recently moved in with her new boyfriend.  They've been together for about a year prior to his moving in.  

Unfortunately, her boyfriend drinks to excess and gets aggressive when drunk.  About a month ago, he hurt her hand very badly; it swelled up and turned blue, and even now she can't use it normally.  She is a concert pianist, so her hands are her livelihood.  He was all weepy and apologetic afterwards, and she forgave him, and came up with all sorts of creative justifications for his behavior - but even after doing that to her, he hasn't stopped drinking.

He hasn't hurt her again since that incident, but I am terribly worried that he will do it again.  I live far away, so I can't come over and intervene directly (much as I'd love to punch his lights out).  

I'd like to help her somehow, but I'm not sure what I can do or say that will actually make her realize that this is not a good relationship, and that the violence is not her fault.  I invited her to come visit me for a while, just to get her out of that apartment for a couple of weeks, but while I'm sure it's reducing her stress level just a bit, I'm not sure it's helping her get out of the relationship.  When I expressed my feelings about this sort of relationship (i.e. ""I would call the police, file a restraining order, and change the locks""), she started defending him and coming up with all sorts of justifications for his behavior.  I am sure that if I push too hard, I'll drive her away; and I want to be there as a source of support for when she decides she needs it.

If any of you who have been there would be willing to give me some advice, I will be very grateful.  This is a very good friend of mine, she's helped me in a lot of ways over the years, and I'm terribly worried about her.

mc97j,"Thanks for this, I've been needing a place to go to lately.  Instances of abuse riddle my life's history. The thing is, I am still discovering the abuse I continue to go through and it's tough to deal with at this time in my life. I'm pregnant. I'm single. A caring family is never something that I had and my friendships have degraded into almost nothing. So... thank you to those who have opened up a safe place for me and others inside of a place we already call our internet home. Community is one of our most powerful tools. 


I want to connect with the readers here. I suspect I'll be posting in a lot of the threads because people who have been abused seem to have so many things in common. That's part of the healing process, finding others who know the terrible emotions behind abuse. I know what I won't be saying, though. I won't be coming into threads and saying sorry for what has happened and singing praises of strength. It is good to have that validation, but there is already too much of it here. You say sorry to victims. You share stories with survivors. Our community must be strong enough to stop saying sorry and start having real conversations. 


We all have weak moments and again I'm thankful for this subreddit as it has potential to provide for me what is missing from my life; support. I just wanted to let you guys know. I think this can be a great thing for a lot of us here. The end:)

2vdydf,"Financial responsibility vs. Pursuing dreams I suppose this kind of question needs some context. I'm 21 years old, I grew up in Tacoma Washington and in all honesty made a pretty good deal out of a shit upbringing. My father sadly was addicted to drugs, my mother did her best but raising three kids on her own wasn't easy neither was I.

I have ADHD, formerly medicated though I stopped taking it for a variety of anger management and control reasons. School was very easy for me, so easy I took it upon myself to skip classes and merely get high test marks and pass with a low gpa.

I dropped out of school when I was sixteen to work full time, moved out when I was seventeen and I've been a part of the carpenters union making good money since I was nineteen. 

My dilemma is this. I'm not happy with what I do, I hate doing construction and while I have tons of respect for what I do it's not a future I can see myself doing. I really wish I had applied myself more in school, I'd like to go to University though I'd probably have to settle and go to a community college for two years. 

If I'm not pushed or actively engaged I'll just tune out, my question is to whether you think I should continue making ( very good ) money in carpentry or opt out and go back to school. Honestly it's hard for me, I'm a realist and I'm terrified of failure.

I've kind of been a fuck up my entire life, my family finally see's me accomplishing something but I'm just miserable doing it.

Did my anxiety have anything to do with my heart this morning? i wasn't anxious this morning, i mean i was walking fast , not like almost running, but i was walking fast because i don't like getting to school late and ill get a little stressed if i'm running a little late, like i was today. I keep telling my self that i'm fine, i run cross country, run every morning, but the hypochondriac in me keeps coming out, any thoughts?",non_abuse,"['weird', 'heart', 'thing', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'morning', 'walking', 'school', 'nowhere', 'felt', 'like', 'heart', 'jumping', 'stuff', 'like', 'pounding', 'hard', 'weird', 'either', 'heart', 'like', 'middle', 'chest', 'twitching', 'something', 'anyways', 'anxiety', 'since', 'last', 'summer', 'uncle', 'died', 'shit', 'hit', 'fan', 'turned', 'hypochondriac', 'well', 'normal', 'anxiety', 'anxiety', 'anything', 'heart', 'morning', 'anxious', 'morning', 'mean', 'walking', 'fast', 'like', 'almost', 'running', 'walking', 'fast', 'like', 'getting', 'school', 'late', 'ill', 'get', 'little', 'stressed', 'running', 'little', 'late', 'like', 'today', 'keep', 'telling', 'self', 'fine', 'run', 'cross', 'country', 'run', 'every', 'morning', 'hypochondriac', 'keeps', 'coming', 'thoughts']"

35hwmv,"I need information. In short, my girlfriend's step-grandfather has been beating, gas lighting, and cheating on his wife for her entire life. He beats her even now, in her old age, while she is in very poor health. Yesterday, on mother's day, he told her granddaughter to never return to their house.

This situation is bizarre, and I do not understand it. I am new to the scene, and know that I cannot change things where others have tried. However, I still would like to prepare a document for her. Something with information on how to take control of the situation. At least she can know it's possible... perhaps her mind is still in the '50s.

Advise? This is a situation where everyone has given up and accepted that things are the way they are. 

What information should I give to her? This is in the state of Virginia.

2wxwbl,"My paycheck just bounced or something. What should I do? So here's the story.  I got paid on Friday.  I went and deposited it in the bank and it went though immediately.  So I have money in my account.  I used half to put on my credit card, since I like to pay bills on it to get cash back.  The other half I kept in my checking for a money order for rent and spending money.  So now my bank account has money in it by the end of Friday.  

Today I went to go buy groceries, so I went to use my bank card.  It ended up getting declined.  WTF I have $400 in the bank!  So that was embarrassing, since I had to leave a whole cart of groceries and walk out.  So I went online to the banking site to see what was up.  Apparently my account is hundreds of dollars in the negative!  What?!?  

There is a withdrawal from today for the amount of my check that I deposited Friday.  What?  So I just called the 24 hour bank hotline.  What I understand is this.  When I deposited the check, it basically put ""pretend money"" in my account.  The check actually takes a couple days to process before it makes the ""pretend money"" into ""real money.""  When it went to process my paycheck, it bounced for some reason.  He couldn't tell my why.  The common reasons is that the account is closed, or it didn't have money in it.  So now it took all my ""pretend money"" out of the account leaving me hundreds of dollars in the negative.  He told me it is something to ask the issuer of my check, as in my boss.

So I called my boss.  He doesn't know what the heck happened.  There's plenty of money in the account to pay everyone, so he thinks it's something with the bank and tells me to go see them tomorrow.  I called some of my coworkers to ask if they had any problems with their checks and they said no.  So this has only happened to me.

Of course I can't visit the bank until tomorrow, but the waiting is killing me.  I just want to find out where the heck my money went, and why it only happened to me.  I have bills to pay, and now I'm up to $60 in overdrafts with more on the way.  I'm livid right now, but there's nothing I can do about it.

Has this kind of thing happened to anyone else?  I work at a restaurant, not anything seedy or under the table.  I've never had this happen before.  Will the bank reverse the overdrafts?

I feel like I'm on the verge of a panic attack, that I have to escape from whatever is suffocating me right now. My room is a disaster. I haven't done laundry in weeks. I've been unable to do much of anything aside from sit in my room and try to study (which hasn't been effective). The fact that my room is just sitting here like this is disgusting to me. I know that it would take me a half an hour, *at most*, to clean it, but I just can't. The thought of taking everything out of its current place and putting it somewhere else while I organize it makes me want to throw up. I don't want to leave my room to go to class, though. A part of me is so excited for my future and for the big things happening in my life, and a part of me just wishes I could waste away in this disgusting room. I kind of just want to sit here and be miserable forever. I know that if I just tried to smile, I would feel better. That's the neat thing about the body. I don't want to, though. That's another neat thing about the body: that I could be so addicted to my anxiety and feelings of worthlessness that I actually feel happier being this way than being happy. There are so many other people who would love to be in my situation, but of course I'm the one who's here. When I express this concern to people, they always remind me that I'm here because I worked for it. Sure, but I can't help but feel like an imposter sometimes.

2t6qe4,"Last job was extremely micromanaging, new job is not. I can't relax. The job I've spent the last almost year working for had really terrible upper management.  All they ever did was micromanage us and watch us on the cameras from corporate - literally.  I'd get a call telling me my shoe is untied, saying I don't look 'perky' enough, or that I should make sure I'm standing at the back of the store instead of the front of the store because xyz, anything you can think of.  I've spent months feeling like I'm always being watched, and it's affected me outside of work as well.  The job would also often call me when I wasn't at work, even on days I was totally off.

The other issue is that due to labor cuts back in the summer/fall and the store manager walking out, I was put in charge of the store with little experience running it, but I was literally working alone day in and day out.  By myself for 8+ hours, and during the first half of the day when we are slow, I would literally be alone for hours at a time.  But as the great eye in the sky would have it, I couldn't use any social media or be on my phone without a nastygram or a phone call.  It got pretty damn lonely. 

In my new job, I work in an office and when anyone walks by my cube I tense up and look in the corner of my eye to see who it is and if they're looking at me.  I always feel like I'm being watched and observed even though I know that's not the case.  I think this causes me anxiety from the job that follows my mind outside of work, and sometimes I have difficulty relaxing and stopping myself from thinking about work.  When I'm at work and I'm having difficulty with something (even though I'm still learning and will be for another few weeks) I feel very tense and worry, which deters me from being as productive.

2tst7u,"Something to keep in mind when you are having an anxiety attack Not too long ago, I noticed that when I am having an anxiety attack, my mind tends to believe that whatever thought goes through it, is either one more cause of anxiety, or something that will increase it. I'm not entirely sure how to explain this, so I'm going to give you guys an example:

Let's say that I start getting anxious because I am soon going to move to a new apartment. My mind starts racing, my thoughts get fuzzy, I feel stressed and worried, my stomach starts feeling weird,  etc. The usual symptoms. If, during that anxiety period, I start thinking about how my dog is not listening to me when I tell him to sit, my mind will feed the anxiety attack with that event. I will now start getting worried about a new branch of issues: I have not trained my dog well, he may have hearing problems, he has not exercised enough, etc. And from that moment, every time I think about my dog, I get more anxious. My dog becomes a trigger.

I realized that I do this often, and before I was aware of it, my anxiety would last much more time because the number of triggers would grow exponentially. But fortunately, I quickly learned how to control it:


1. Isolate the real issue that is causing your current anxiety attack. If my first trigger was the idea of moving to a new apartment, then I find a more specific and deeper reason: oh, so I'm actually getting anxious because this is a 12 month decision, and I'm scared about such long commitment.

2. Find a set of solutions to your problem, or reasons why you should not worry about this event: I made a list of pros and cons of living in my current apartment and living in the new one. I reminded myself how happy I felt when I saw the apartment and the neighborhood where it was located. I also reminded me how convenient it would be for me to get to work from now on. I reminded myself that it was not a life-long decision, just one year, I have enough money to break the lease any time and move somewhere else, etc.

3. If, while I'm looking for a solution to the real problem, I start thinking about other things, and I start feeling they are turning into additional triggers, I shut my mind up for a moment: I just stop thinking; forcing my thoughts to stop passing so quickly. I breathe deeply and slowly, and I start thinking again, slowly, but from a more distanced perspective and a clearer and calmer mind. I learned this technique thanks to meditation.

These steps have helped me reduce the time my anxiety attacks last, as well as the intensity. I wanted to share, in case it helps someone.

1h4kpt,"I'm kinda angry with life So, I wasn't aware of the existence of this sub until a couple minutes ago, and I hope I don't fuck up with this post. Excuse me if I do. Sometimes I have completely irrational reactions to very ordinary mishappenings. Today, for instance, as I was talking on the phone with the mechanic who promised me my car would be ready today, after a (motherfucking) week, he told me he will be done by friday. I raged and threw my phone, and it so happened that it hit my mother's laptop and broke the screen. So fuck, now I don't have a car, for which I have to pay 600 bucks, and I also have to pay for a new screen. I graduated a year ago and haven't been able to find a job, my hair is falling out, my ex left me for a fucking asshole who apparently considered himself my friend (although I have had trouble with him before, because he is a fucking asshole). I am so fed up with all the shit. I wish it all was easier. I'm fed up with the fucking lemons! I don't want any more fucking lemonade! 

Sorry for bitching and whining, but I figured this is kind of a place for it. 

Also, I smoke a about 10-20 cigarettes a day, and I ran out yesterday afternoon. After breaking the laptop I bought some, played some guitar, and it helped me relax a lot. Weed also helps a lot, but I also ran out of that yesterday. I'd love to find something like a Fight Club (from the book/movie Fight Club) where I can go and beat the shit out of someone, and get my shit beaten out of me. Any of you do that sort of stuff?

It's probably nothing to be worried about, but my sister has grown up with tachycardia (Irregular heart beat) just like my dad.

2dbht7,"Help with No Contact and dealing with run-ins? This has been bugging me for awhile.

Ever since I escaped my abusive parents a few years ago, my relatives have fallen into the whole Obligation mentality and have tried to suck me in by insinuating that I am petty, shallow or misguided for breaking contact and leaving behind the abusive household.

I have been adamant about staying away from them and it keeps being warped as the actions of a spoiled child running away.

How do I deal with my relatives? In the time Ive been away, theyve painted me as the Problem of the family and have all seemed to have turned on me and enabled my ""parents"" in almost getting into contact twice.

The thing that gets under my skin the most is how they're all like ""let it go"" and ""forgive them"" like it was some sort of trash TV reunion special. And I cant convince them that it has nothing to do with that. Its about staying away from people who hurt me.

(Note, this all happened a year or so ago spaced out into several months.)

Is there a way to turn my relatives around or should I see them as part of the problem? Or do I have the wrong mentality about this?

I ask this because I have a relative who is very dear to me that I want to see again and should I approach I will inevitably walk into a hornet's nest and even confronted by my abusers.

My other problem is work. I cant hold the same job in public places for very long because Im scared that my abusers will find me and passive-aggressively harass me or just plain harass me at work.

What are my options if something like this happens? Im scared that they will prowl around my place of work and be in a position to mentally/emotionally abuse me, and for a supervisor do nothing because the situation isnt overtly aggressive.",abuse,"['help', 'contact', 'dealing', 'run', 'ins', 'bugging', 'awhile', 'ever', 'since', 'escaped', 'abusive', 'parents', 'years', 'ago', 'relatives', 'fallen', 'whole', 'obligation', 'mentality', 'tried', 'suck', 'insinuating', 'petty', 'shallow', 'misguided', 'breaking', 'contact', 'leaving', 'behind', 'abusive', 'household', 'adamant', 'staying', 'away', 'keeps', 'warped', 'actions', 'spoiled', 'child', 'running', 'away', 'deal', 'relatives', 'time', 'ive', 'away', 'theyve', 'painted', 'problem', 'family', 'seemed', 'turned', 'enabled', 'parents', 'almost', 'getting', 'contact', 'twice', 'thing', 'gets', 'skin', 'like', 'let', 'go', 'forgive', 'like', 'sort', 'trash', 'tv', 'reunion', 'special', 'cant', 'convince', 'nothing', 'staying', 'away', 'people', 'hurt', 'note', 'happened', 'year', 'ago', 'spaced', 'several', 'months', 'way', 'turn', 'relatives', 'around', 'see', 'part', 'problem', 'wrong', 'mentality', 'ask', 'relative', 'dear', 'want', 'see', 'approach', 'inevitably', 'walk', 'hornet', 'nest', 'even', 'confronted', 'abusers', 'problem', 'work', 'cant', 'hold', 'job', 'public', 'places', 'long', 'im', 'scared', 'abusers', 'find', 'passive', 'aggressively', 'harass', 'plain', 'harass', 'work', 'options', 'something', 'like', 'happens', 'im', 'scared', 'prowl', 'around', 'place', 'work', 'position', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'abuse', 'supervisor', 'nothing', 'situation', 'isnt', 'overtly', 'aggressive']"

From current relationship/romantic help, to OCD paranoia possibly returning, I know I should be seeing a therapist soon. But my most recent one left my network and charges $90/45min. 

I've been to IOP and they suggest journaling. My thoughts just run much faster than my pen. It almost frustrates me having to wait for me to finish the letters as my thoughts are steps ahead.

I no longer want to dump, well lightly place, my issues on my boyfriend. He's amazing, but it is awkward mentioning things about post relationships

Mainly, deep down there is so much I'm embarrassed of our ashamed of that I've done, and wish I could get over them and forget. Over learned but I want the pain gone.

2u6azc,"I know this is cheesy, but it gets better guys. I promise. (For anyone dealing with panic disorder) Awhile back I had my first panic attack. It was honestly the most terrifying thing that's ever happened to me. I wasn't even aware that my body could do that, and it scared the crap out of me. It scared me so much that I began having literally 3 panic attacks a day just because I was scared of panic attacks. It's a terrible cycle. I didn't know what to do. I felt hopeless, I couldn't work like I used to, and I was constantly locked in my room freaking out. I finally decided to get help, and it was so freaking worth it. I went to my doctor, and he prescribed an SSRI called zoloft. I was scared of taking it, and to be honest, the side effects from it really scared me at first. He also gave me a bottle of xanax, which worked a little bit to well for me. I couldn't leave the house without taking one, and it was like I had a 3 hour timer counting down whenever I was out of my house to tell me how long I could stay out until my drugs wore off and I went back to being a nervous wreck. Now on top of my anxiety I was becoming a drug addict. Great. Now i feel like I've broken myself, but then, just when I think my life is over.  somthing good happens. I forgot to take my Xanax at work one day. It didn't even cross my mind. I was to busy talking to people, which was weird because before then I didn't talk to anyone at work before. As I was driving home I felt oddly happy. I believe it was awhile after I started taking zoloft so it was most likely that starting to work. From that point on, I'm not gonna lie, I had some ups and downs. Depersonalization, anxiety, occasional panic attack, but I didn't let that get me down, I just saw it as a little set back. Even if I was having a panic attack, I wasn't getting that feeling of dread that came with it anymore, and I sort of learned to keep my cool while it was happening. After that it wasn't so scary. One day I decided to stop taking my xanax to feel secure and only use it for legitimate Panic attacks. It took me awhile to get here, but now I keep only one pill with me in my wallet, and my bottle of pills is sitting on my dresser. I just noticed today that the bottle has dust on it. I haven't touched it in that long. I know I'm not completely cured, but now I can go out and talk to people and have fun and I've even went on a date with somone I really like. Sorry if this is boring or not worth your time to read, but I just wanted to tell anyone who's feeling hopeless that it's going to be okay. Things  look freaking rough now, I know, I've been there. I don't feel like I'm the strongest person in the world, but if I made it from having 3 panic attacks a day to having just an occasional panic attack maybe once every 3 months, I think you can do it too. It seems impossible. It feels like your life is ruined. It's not. It's not, because you're stronger than that.

28frar,"[Venting] I'm a child sexual abuse survivor, I thought I was ready to date, realized I'm not. That realization was painful enough without the insensitive things she said when I broke it off So, I'm 23, and I've never really dated because, well, I have issues, most of which have to do with being ashamed of all my sexual impulses, and having trust issues. 

When this girl and I started to talk, I made her aware of what I was dealing with pretty early on, and I was very hopeful because she didn't seem to mind. She was comfortable taking things as slowly as I wanted to. 

We talked all the time, I began to know the joys of flirting, it was great. But it wasn't long before I wasn't able to stave off my trust issues any longer, and soon all of her nice compliments started to feel like manipulative lies (even though I knew they weren't)

I decided it was too painful for me to keep talking to her, and not fair to her either. 

At first she seemed to take the breakup remarkably well, she thanked me for letting her know what was going on, and said she'd be around if I changed my mind. 

But two days later, she asked me if I was breaking up with her because she is a transwoman. 

I was very very hurt by the question. Although I realized later it's perfectly understandable for a trans person to wonder if that's a factor, at the time, to have her suggest that I had lied about the affects of my abuse, or had simply used it as an excuse, it stung very badly. 

Once I reassured her that we were ending things because of my stated motive and nothing else, she dropped this little nugget of joy on me:

&gt; ""But if you keep being too afraid to let someone get close to you, you are going to be alone forever.""

Hey, wow! What a coincidence, that's my biggest fear! And it's frustrating because the part of my brain that can't trust unconditional kindness just feels validated like, *see? she was just insensitive all along. She didn't care about your feelings.*

&gt; ""I can see us going far... but you have to overcome whatever you are afraid of...""

Do I? DO I???? But I was just planning on having no romantic or sexual interactions for the rest of my life, that sounded like fun to me. 

So, just admitting to myself that I wasn't ready to date is one of the hardest things I've had to do in ages. The few days leading up to it and the few days afterward, I felt like a failure, I felt broken, I felt hopeless, and I was just picking myself up again when this shit happens.

1xltsc,"Why can't I say no? I've shared my story before, as a child I was sexually abused by my grandfather. I've spent all of my adult life trying to cope with the results of this abuse. I've had intimacy issues, guilt, anger and all the rest of the usual symptoms. It bothers me that I can't work out if my interest in BDSM is because of my earliest sexual encounters.

But today, I've come to vent on a different matter.

I have a really hard time saying no to men, I've let myself get into some pretty stupid and dangerous situations because I just don't want to make people angry. I'm constantly worried that I'll end up cheating on my husband, not because I want to but because it's the easiest way out of a situation.

A few nights ago I was at a party with my husband. A much older guy I'd never met before was there and he immediately took a shine to me. I got way too drunk and he was following me round trying to kiss me. I didn't want to cause a fuss so I let him, he tried to put his tongue in my mouth but I managed to keep my teeth closed but still he was trying and touching me.

My husband had no idea that I was so uncomfortable and didn't see any problem with what was happening. I felt so vulnerable and scared. Getting drunk was stupid.

It keeps playing in my mind, everything that the man was saying and trying to do.

2v6zdc,"Afraid to date, because the date is too beautiful. Okay guys..

So my friend sent a snapshot of me, to her friend who found me attractive, she asked for my Facebook and snapchat, well she added me and we've been texting for a few days now, and sending snapshots to each other, I find her very beautiful, like basically she could get any guy under her command. Me on other hand, I would like to say that I do look okay except for one part which is my gigantic nose, I've done a pretty good job in snapchat by covering it up with text and stuff. I did however send some pictures which revealed everything, she has not commented anything negative about it but I'm still worried.

Now she wants to meet, but I'm too afraid that she might get disappointed by my nose or something, that whenever she asks, I  tell her some bad excuse to avoid meeting her. I'm in a state of confussion, I know I can't keep her as my letter friend, but I'm afraid to risk loosing her if she finds me unattractive. 

Now my question is am I doomed to get rejected when she meets me or is there by any chance that personality is gonna have an effect? Although she was clearly out for looks only, as she previously stated in her text. And to you girls, does the nose really play such a huge role?

qy2t7,"How much do you tell your partner about your previous/current abuse if your partner isn't the abuser?  I'm closeted gay because when I came out my parents threatened to kick me out, and as guilty as this makes me feel I've never been on my own and they are paying for medical school. So in my head at least, I'm trapped. 

For all my life my parents have been in an abusive relationship. It used to be physically abusive (they would mostly hit each other, not the kids) and now they just fight often. They have however been emotionally pretty abusive. They have always called me arrogant, stuck up, inhumane, a bitch, and fat. I'm not a saint, but I think the picture they paint out for me is harsh especially now. 

Since my parents found out, even though now they believe I'm not gay, they threaten me to be normal. And oscillate between calling me all of these horrible things and then kindly inviting me to a walk and saying ""you know we love you and we're just trying to keep you on a straight path""

I'm not really sure how to get out of this situation, and to be honest I'm scared of leaving my family since financially I've never been on my own. 

AS PER THE TITLE:
While all of this is going on, how much should I tell my partner? I've told her a lot to date, but it makes me feel guilty to complain about a situation that I can't change.

2pvyxm,"Not sure if worth reporting, need advice So my partner went out last night with some work buddies and stumbled back very drunk at 4am. This behaviour is something that has previously caused a lot of conflict in our relationship and was not meant to still be happening. I was obviously very upset but they fell straight asleep. I was reluctant to stay in the same room and retreated to the spare bedroom where I locked myself in.

Around 7am they woke, couldn't find me and came looking, banging on the door. I told them that I was upset with their behaviour, that I didn't want to see them right now and to go away. They ignored this and began ramming the door over and over with their shoulder until they forced the lock through the splintered door frame and pushed their way in. Fortunately they were still too drunk to have any coherent plan of what to do upon making it inside and proceeded to follow me out, at which point I darted back in, closed the door behind me and slid a dresser in front of it. They then went back to sleep. I was not physically harmed in any way although I was very intimidated by the aggression of physically forcing the door and their refusal to accept that I didn't want to interact with them at that time.

I have previously been abused by partners and find any ignoring of consent, shouting and physically intimidating behaviour triggering. My partner knows this and is normally respectful of my limits. What should I do? We're both on the lease together, there has been no physical violence and I have nowhere to go so I have no ability to put any distance between us. I'm sure there will be apologies in the morning but I feel like I shouldn't just drop it, that this is indicative of a problem and that I'll regret not at least reporting it if it continues.

2toldm,"My social anxiety has crept into my drinking personality. I'm a gay man in a big city trying to get back out there. 

I quit taking my zoloft, because I don't want to be held down to anxiety medicine for the rest of my life. I have been going to the gym 5 days a week and noticed I have more energy and what not.

However, I can be a bit of a weekend warrior when it comes to drinking. I'm an awkward guy and sometimes just have a really hard time fully being myself at bars or social gatherings on Fridays.

However, I've noticed and a lot of my friends do to, when I get drunk, I laugh and giggle act happy. However, I have this complex where I think everyone is mad at me and wants me to leave. So, I a lot of times just flee the situation. It's causing some friends to either get annoyed or even concerned about me.

It's also working against me in romantic situations, because I'm trying to get out there. But when I try to flirt or use these apps, it just comes off completely wrong and not eloquent at all.

I plan on taking my zoloft again tomorrow and starting and try to keep myself from drinking this weekend. However, the problem is that it's my 24th birthday and I have a lot of friends coming to my apartment to do some fun things and then to go out. I secretly regret even creating this event, but I'm lonely and want to be around all my friends.

I'm just afraid if I start drinking, I'm going to have this issue and it's going to heighten, because I'll be around several of my friends. 

It's embarrassing. I just want to be taken seriously, but oddly, I am optimistic that I will take control of the situation and be a better me in the end.

He's thrown firecrackers at me, spat on me, and cracked a **literal** leather whip at myself and my siblings. I'm the youngest by a lot, the only female and my father never put any effort into my care. My parents are still together and I still live at home while going to college.

Every time I try to bring up my father's abuse my mother just tells me her father was worse or tells me what my father did wasn't abuse. My own brother even implied that I somehow deserved the abuse because of any childhood pranks I may have pulled (i.e. drawing on his stomach  or dropping pennies down his pants). My father was a lot nicer to my brothers than he was to me and my mother and brothers just keep coming up with excuses for him. 

I'm so frustrated because although everyone else I know acknowledges his actions, my close family members do not and literally tell me I'm being overly sensitive or overreacting. I'm at a complete loss and I feel alone in my own home. Every time I try to talk to my mother about this she always says ""I don't want to talk about it"" or again, brings up her ""more abusive"" father. Is there anything I can do when the people I love are in such denial? Do I just have to sit and bear it, change my  perspective, or just write them off?

This is what I've been doing so far to keep myself from sinking into the couch under a pile of Haagen Dazs cartons: I cut off contact with him, I run, I started kayaking, I call friends or family when I feel like calling him, I try to concentrate on my work (though this is still difficult), I see a wonderful therapist once a week, I play every day with my traumatized cat (who is finally coming around!), I read a chapter of my book on codependency, I write in a journal if I feel really trapped on some negative thought, and I try to go out to a friend's for dinner or a concert or something new.

2uo3lt,"[Meds] Non-SSRI medication for anxiety? Hello there!

I've been diagnosed with panic attacks and anxiety since 2007. I used to take a SSRI-medicine called Sertalin, I took it around 2007-2009 but I got some very nasty side effects so I had to quit it. My anxiety (and every other feeling I had) disappeared and I have trouble remembering things (even to this day!) thanks to this medication.

Sadly, recently my anxiety has returned. I feel very sick, like I have fever and my stomach hurts - I'm on the verge to cry since I shake badly and feel weak. Almost everything triggers my anxiety now, I don't know why. 

So my question; is there any medication that is **not** a SSRI that could help against anxiety (WITHOUT making me a careless zombie)? If so, have any of you tried them and what result did you have? Did you have side-effects?

I discussed this with my therapist this morning and she said she couldn't think of any and have to ask around.

2w7lc8,"Should I take a year off in between my undergraduate and graduate years. Hello reddit!
I'm currently in my very last semester as an undergraduate at college. I will be getting my degree in June! Yay! However, I applied to 2 college graduate programs to continue on in my education. My first choice graduate school didn't accept me, I'm kind of offended and upset. I'm still in the process of applying to the backup but I just don't feel the motivation because it's not my first choice.

My question is... should I take a year off after I get my bachelor degree? I would work during this year gaining experience in my field and then at the end re-applying to my first choice program and hope they accept me this time. I just didn't plan on taking the year off and really want to just keep going until my schooling is done but idk....

If I take the year off, I can work and save up money. Build experience and have a better chance at getting into the program. And have a year to myself which would be unlikely to happen if I went straight to graduate school since I'd be going into my career for life.

If I don't take the year off then I can get my schooling all done with no breaks. Start my career sooner. Don't have to move in back home.

My step father got really angry with my mother because she did not tell him there was going to be a religious function at our house until a few days before the event. When she told him he didn't reply back. This was over the phone. He makes it home the day before the event and everything seems okay until out of nowhere he starts shouting insults at my mother. My mother apologizes and says it was not a big issue and she wouldn't do it again. He doesn't listen and tells her to go to her room or he will kill her. She pleads with him and says I'm sorry I didn't mean to do anything wrong. He keeps telling her he's going to kill her and the kids if she doesn't go upstairs. Then he grabs a knife and is going to go after him. I grab him so he doesnt hurt her. He drops the knife and settles down. My mom says please don't do anything I'm sorry. He then tries to get her again. I grab him by the waist and hold him back. He starts to kick at me and I throw him against the wall. He gets angry and starts to hit me. My mom says don't hit my son please. He stops, grabs his stuff then leaves. The next day he sends a text saying last warning don't talk to me. He comes home and again starts threatening us. He tells us he told his friends and they will back him up. We call out relatives in order to talk some sense into him. My mom doesn't want to break up the family because my sister is very young. The relatives talk to him and calm him down. He tells them to tell us not to bug him and let him cool down. We do exactly that. But today at dinner he was drinking and said he was gonna kill me for throwing him on the wall but didn't because he I'm innocent and it is all my mother's fault. He tells me if I hurt him his friends will come and kill me on the spot. He put a lock on a room in the house and tells us he has a gun in there. At dinner he kept on verbally abusing my mom calling her characterless. He said she only survived because of my sister. He said he will kill her if she does anything against his wishes. He said he will have me killed if hit him or if he dies. 
He is also the breadwinner of the family and I am in college. My mom works a small income job. My sis is in elementary school. 

TL;DR: step father got into an argument. Threatened to kill family. Don't know what to do. Says he kill my mom if she takes custody of the kids or if she does anything wrong. I don't know what to do.

I jumped a serious hurdle getting my last job. It was a miracle I made it to the interview after not working since 2009. But the last job really screwed with my head. None of my managers would give me any criticism or let me know if I was doing a good job, and then froze me out for not doing a volunteer thing. 
I really want to get a job with plants. Ace hardware, floral shops, that kind of thing. I volunteered at an herb farm for a few months. But looking for those jobs I can't help but think ""I am really good with plants, I would love to work with them! What if I'm not as good as I think? What if they hate me? They're going to hate me. I can't do it.""
I really don't want to be stuck in regular retail forever. And I don't want to be a damn housewife. I want to do something I love! I want my hypothetical kids to feel like they can reach for stuff and attain it, and not be frozen by fear of inadequacy.

Our fights tend to escalate because he usually becomes angry and says hurtful things, at which point I try to leave his house so that we can both calm down and talk later. He always tries to prevent me from leaving, whether it's holding my arm and not letting me go, blocking access to the door, dumping the contents of my purse/bags on the floor, throwing my keys across the room, holding my cell phone and not giving it back...etc. Those behaviors are alarming on their own but he also has thrown a glass of water on me (twice), pushed me down, and the other night things were worse than they had ever been. He went through my cell phone when I was passed out (we had been drinking and celebrating my birthday which was the day before) and was awoken to him screaming at me and calling me a whore because of a text exchange with a guy that happened BEFORE we even started dating. I refuse to be disrespected in that manner and told him I was leaving. He begged me to stay and talk and would not stop grabbing me. I told him to stop touching me and pushed him back. He pushed me as well, HARD, and I stumbled backwards into a corner of the wall and ended up with bruises down my back. I think it opened my eyes because the other times had not really been physically violent. This time I have a sore back that reminds me every time I move a certain way and a tangent, physical reminder in the form of bruises. He has been apologetic and seems to be trying for the Best Boyfriend of the Universe award since then. I just can't forget what happened, no matter how good our other times are. I'm stressed and keep thinking about it and I'm still living with him right now. I wanted to try and work on things with him but I can't even bring up the topic of what happened without him making me feel bad for ""hating"" him. I don't, but I can't pretend that it didn't happen. All he says is that he's sorry and would never hurt me.

pzq21,"Reaching out and being rejected - messy friendships between survivors I don't know where to begin.


My dad was violent with me growing up. From what I saw, he reserved such behavior for only me and not my mom or brother. I never understood why. I have always thought of myself as bad because of it, I guess. We all got away when I was 12. He was a respected community member and the abuse made me feel ashamed, confused and isolated for so long. I still have not come to terms with it even though I'm now in my 20's. He has another family now. 


I feel like I'm still healing. But the past year has been tumultuous with regards to my friends. Two of them got into abusive relationships. I actually witnessed the violence first hand with one of them, because she was my roommate. I did what I could, they even broke up for a little, but when the lease ended I had to get out of there. I remember one night I heard them fighting and I started shaking I was so afraid. They have since broken up but that permanently affected our friendship. As terrible as it sounds and without going into further detail, I am not sure I can forgive her for what she put me through.


The other friend was from high school and she lived in another city. Then, she got a job on the other side of the country and was going to move with her boyfriend. I was suspicious because she falls in love so easily and the few times that I met this boy, I wasn't impressed. I don't know why, I guess my bad guy radar went off. They didn't last long together out there, but naturally she wasn't very communicative about it so I don't know much. She gave indications of abuse, but never said outright that he hit her until very recently. I think now that she has come out with it, she wants to turn to me for support, but I find that difficult. Selfish, right? Well, the thing is, I am a lesbian, and she is straight, but we've always had a flirtatious friendship. However, as I see her vulnerability, I'm wondering if I need to keep my distance in order to prevent heartbreak. Is that just the battered syndrome talking? Why do I feel like we're battling for control over our relationship? We're at very different places in our lives, and she has been cruel to me about the fact that she has a stressful, high status job and I'm an underemployed, lazy freelancer. I just don't feel like the way we communicate is healthy. To be honest, I've been trying to create some space between us. But then she just put something on her tumblr that made my stomach lurch, a picture that her ex took when trashed a bunch of her stuff. I felt the same way I did when I used to listen to my roommate fight with her boyfriend... like I can't hide from all this shitty-ness.

2478r7,"Just need to vent I created this throwaway because I just really needed to vent.

I am a mid-twenties male who has everything going for him in life. I am getting married to my soulmate who I have been with since high-school, I own a house, have a good paying job, graduated university with zero debt (same with my soon-to-be wife), have plenty of money, great health, pretty much every aspect of my life is perfect. I'm even having a hard time making this list because there are so many aspects of my life that are even better than my wildest expectations.

This year we are taking on a lot of things: renovating the entire house, selling it, moving to our home town, getting married, finding new jobs and all the little things that come along with the rest. Granted these things are adding stress to my life but all of them are going according to plan. I really don't have anything to complain about at all.

But I cannot stop being angry. 

I wake up in the morning and go to my office (I work from home), start work and soon enough my heart rate starts to rise, my head begins to pound and I am trying my best to not break every item in the room. If my fiancee isn't home I find myself screaming, breaking things and yelling at the cat if it comes anywhere near me. I hate my job (who doesn't?), but it is really a perfect fit for my life right now and it pays great. Other than the fact that the company I work for is terrible and will probably be falling apart soon, there is nothing wrong with the job.

The same thing happens when I am doing work on the house. When anything even begins to go slightly wrong I start to slip and soon find myself lost in anger. I'm a bit of a perfectionist but I also am one of the most easy-going guys I know, so I can't figure out why I get so emotional about small things going slightly wrong.

I smoke pot most evenings because it allows me to take a more realistic look at my life and I find myself no longer being angry and taking a much more appropriate view on my life. Most of my anger comes from self-hating and I know that I putting myself to an unreasonable standard most of the time and pot allows me to truly realize that. But I can't be high all the time, it makes me too lethargic to accomplish everything I need to do in a day.

I don't know where I am going with this, but I just needed to get it out there. I have talked with my fiancee about it before, but I can't bring myself to put the full weight of my situation on her shoulders. She already helps a lot of her friends and family members out with these kinds of situations and I know that it weighs heavily on her. So I thought maybe I could get it out here and at least have my thoughts made whole. I haven't been happy in almost a year, and I just wade through most days waiting until the next one. I keep hopeful that when all of the current stress is over and we return to our hometown that things will get better.

So thanks for reading, it helps to at least get my thoughts out.

Normally, people who struggle with emotional stability (and can't stay happy) are told to do the things that they enjoy the very most when they start to feel under the weather psychologically, but my level of emotional sensitivity doesn't allow me to do that without often traumatic results.

If anything at all goes wrong, it can and will ruin my mood at the moment, for the day, or even for the week. If a video-game session doesn't go exactly like I wanted, if the pizza I ordered isn't made the way I had hoped, if I want to play with my cat and she bites me because she wants to be left alone... things like these (mostly, but not always) make me want to crawl in a hole and cry, as if something tragic had happened.

Living life for me is like tip-toeing around a field of landmines everywhere I go, which makes me want to do the only thing I know won't set off my anxiety-- lay in bed, in the dark, and do absolutely nothing.

This, by the way, is with the help of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication. Which seem like it will turn into a pipe dream soon, since I have no health insurance and can't afford any since I'm unemployed.

2xrcrm,"I can't tell if the nausea I'm having is anxiety or caused by something else. How do you handle your anxiety-related nausea? For the last few months I've been experiencing intermittent nausea and back pain. They usually occur at the same time and are worse when I haven't eaten. 

I have had the nausea at times that I wouldn't consider stressful in my life, but then I definitely recognise that the nausea is exacerbated by stress. The last week I've had a lot of relationship stress and the nausea is now debilitating. I've been coming home from work early and sleeping as much as I can because the feeling is so horrid I'm struggling to function. 

I have seen a doctor who has checked me for pregnancy, taken blood samples (to test for gastritis) and given me meds to help reduce the acidity of my stomach (which haven't helped at all), I also started taking some ginger vitamins the pharmacist recommended to me but unfortunately they didn't help either. 

I'm not asking for medical advice, but I wanted to find out what people with anxiety-related nausea do to stop the nausea. I'm tired of going to my doctor every week for more blood tests and now the tests are getting more invasive (pending some bloods he wanted me to get an upper endoscopy next week). I do have this worry that maybe it's all in my head and the nausea is anxiety. In which case, I've never spoken to anyone about that and I don't know how I could 'test' this theory by trying to relieve the anxiety. 

I want so badly to get better because this is taking over my life. I'm not sure if the nausea is caused by anxiety or the nausea is causing anxiety, but I do feel like the intermittent nature of it (I can be fine one day, in bed all day sick the next day) suggests it might be psychologically related, as if it was purely physiological I would imagine it would be more constant. 

Anyways so my point is, I wanted some advice from people who experience this. What management techniques do you use to relieve the nausea? Have you sought professional help, and if so in what capacity and how has it helped?

Thanks

I'm shaking a bit and walk up and pick the only seat that doesn't have someone sitting near it....consequently it's the front row. The professor shoots shit with me for a few, actually made me feel a little more comfortable, but uh oh! He want's us all to introduce ourselves! I thought I dodged that bullet by missing the first class, but apparently he only handed out the syllabus and let everyone leave after that on Tuesday. 

Keep in mind, this is a communications class that I'm required to take for my degree, and this prof also teaches sociology. So, I had to **stand up** and introduce myself. I got my name out...barley and quickly sat down. I felt like everyone was talking about how weird I am for the rest of the class (even though I know that's probably not true) and dammit i felt like I was going to have a heart attack.

1rqjef,"My coworker/friend[22F] confided in me[25M] this morning that her dad ""got physical"" with her during a heated argument. I don't know how to respond. Advice? There are two important factors to this that I don't mention in the title. First of all is the fact that I'm actually in the early stages of developing feelings for this girl. We've been working together for about 6 months, and I've been approaching the situation very delicately because of the second factor...the fact that she and her family are fairly observant Shia Muslims. She wears a hijab every day, dresses pretty conservatively, and so on. I, on the other hand, am a secular white guy and probably not her family's first choice of an ideal match. So, despite being interested in her, I've just been slowly becoming her friend with a little flirting back and forth between us now and again at work. The other day I flirtatiously suggested she should bring me a coffee at work at a time when I'd be working and she'd just be visiting, (we work in retail,) and she responded that she couldn't because her dad would be with her that day and he'd freak out if she brought a boy coffee. In fact, she said if she so much as high-fived a guy her dad would ""never let her hear the end of it.""

Anyway, recently we've been ramping up our closeness a little bit, and she texted me early this morning to tell me that she was upset and didn't want to come to work. She didn't know what to do, she said. I asked why. She said she'd just had a big fight with her dad, ""and it may have gotten physical."" She said I couldn't tell anyone. I asked if she was ok, and she said, ""yeah I'm just great."" I apologized for the dopey question and then offered to meet up with her and talk in between the time my shift was ending and hers was starting, and she said no thanks, it was alright. Haven't spoken since then.

Now, I guess an important question here is whether this incident as a one-time thing or if her father has gotten violent with her before. At this time, I don't know the answer to that, but I'm planning on asking her the next time we talk. But regardless of her answer to that question, I have no idea what I should say, or how I can help. Maybe I should just stay out of it entirely. It's obvious from what I know about her that she struggles between respecting her parents' boundaries and carving her own path. I care about her, so I want to help, but maybe my poking around, asking questions, and getting all carey-feely-protective would just make things worse.

1cudgu,"Looking for help. Confused about possible repressed memories. Recently I've been having recurring flashbacks of abuse as a child. I can't say exactly when the flashbacks first started, but might have been recurring over a number of years, recently becoming more persistent. I'm inclined to think it's a repressed memory, but I feel like it's impossible to be certain that anything actually happened, and part of me just wants to believe I just fabricated it, but then I think ""why would I fabricate such a memory?"" and so I think it must be real. The memory itself is vague and hard to place, but some aspects of it are vividly clear. Still have a close relationship with the supposed ""abuser"" and nothing else in my memory to suggest a history of abuse. I don't at all feel like I could raise such a concern with said person or anyone else in the family. Entirely unsure what to do about it.

Wanting to know, what are other people's experience with repressed memories? Is this a common thing? Is there any way to be sure of their validity? I feel like I'm in emotional limbo, not knowing how to respond to the abuse without first knowing whether it actually occurred or not.

Any comments would be greatly appreciated. I have excellent support in my SO with whom I shared these feelings last night, but I really want to hear from people who relate to my story with the hope of better understanding it all.

2u7f1p,"Scared of driving &amp; losing confidence Long story short, I am 27 and don't have a driver's license. I am scared to drive. I am not good at it.

I feel very uncomfortable when people find out so I decided it is time to get my license. I took some driving classes, but the instructor wasn't really helping me (we just drove around the same neighborhood every time for 5 sessions!!). He wanted more money to take me on the highway. :(

So, I asked my husband to help me out (I have no other friends or family where I live). However, he is not really being that helpful - his attitude is more like ""I won't be there with you when you take the test, so I can't tell you what to do"" and he tells me when I do something wrong AFTER I do it, instead of helping me correct the problem while its happening. 

Anyway, yesterday I was driving and he tells me to ""GO"" at a red light (I was turning right) and then when I turn, he starts yelling ""STOP STOP"" when I had already turned. He totally freaked me out and I was already nervous because there were several cars around me.

So then he blames me for listening to him. Tells me I should know the rules. Explains that when he said ""GO"" he meant ""go around the man on the bike"" (that makes no sense since the man had already moved to the other lane) and then because he thought I turned without checking for cars (I did check), he yelled at me to STOP! And then gets mad when I stopped in the middle of the road when he told me to stop. I thought I was going to hit someone and that is why he was yelling for me to stop. Before that, he also wanted me to pass the man on the bike even though that is something that an experienced driver might feel comfortable doing- I don't have that level of skill.  Anyway, he kind of apologized but not really and said he will ""handicap me"" by telling me exactly what to do next time if that's what I want.  

Anyway, basically, when I practice driving, I lose confidence that I will one day be a good driver. I feel like I am being set up to fail. He tells me he can't ""tell me what to do"" because he won't be always be there when I drive. While I understand that, what he fails to understand is that right NOW 1) I am scared to drive, 2) need practice &amp; guidance because I don't know what I am doing, and 3) I can't drive at the level he drives. I DON'T KNOW HOW!!

Anyway, just wanted to vent about this. I am not sure what I am seeking by posting this. Maybe just tips on driving or comfort that I will one day be able to get my license.

Right now, I am just sad because I know I suck and I don't know how to get better at it when I drive I get more scared and nervous because I feel like I am not good at it. It's like one step forward and two steps back.

wddpl,"How do I forgive and move on? I'm 19. My boyfriend is 21. We've been together for a little over two years and we've been living together for a year.

Backstory: Over the last year and a half my boyfriend has been shoving me, pushing me, and choking me when we get in a fight. Not this past Friday, but the one before, we got in a fight and I went into the bedroom to get my stuff so I could leave. He followed me and I asked him to please leave the room and leave me alone. He wouldn't leave and I kept begging him to please just leave me alone. Well, I was thrown onto the bed and he climbed on top of me and started choking me. I got him off and he held my arms down and started screaming in my face. I tried to push him off with my legs and then all of a sudden he punched me, very, very, hard in the mouth/nose area. I fell on the floor and started bawling. He left the room. I eventually went out and started packing all of my stuff and when I saw him he was crying really hard. 

As of right now we're on a ""break"". I think this might be the end though. He's been horribly mean to me and has punched me in the face more than once. He has insulted everything about me.I can't stand it anymore. My self esteem is shot. I don't even know who I am anymore. He's made me so depressed and I've contemplated suicide on more than one occasion.

I want to forgive him. Not for him, but for me. I know I'll never be able to move forward unless I do. How do I go about doing that? I never imagined being in this position and I have no idea where to begin.

After this how do I move on? All I want is to be happy and for someone to be nice to me.

2u8wsn,"My friend's new faith. My closest friend of 11 years converted to Islam nearly 12 months ago. He's very distant now and I have felt a loss; he's always been like a bro. I'm learning to fill the void with other relationships and activities but for me the relationship we've had has been like family (for me anyway).

I understand that taking the Shahada was a big step for him and I've praised the way he's changed his life around from being somebody that had destructive ways (drinking mainly) to someone that now has a spring in his step who can tackle his problems. He's taken many positive steps in his life since. He'll probably also be married this year too.

I feel like I have to accept that I'm now relegated to the category of ""non-believer"" and therefore not an acceptable relationship for him to justifiably maintain in the eyes of his new faith which as a white convert I gather there is a pressure for him to be perceived as a good example of a muslim. In the Qu'ran, AFAIK it is very black and white on this issue; ""non-believers"" are to be acquaintances only (correct?).

I'm not sure why else he's choosing to wind down how much contact we have. If it is about what kind of influence I am and how that fits with his new schema it isn't like I'm a ""non-believer"" as I am agnostic. I just haven't subscribed to any religion or been brought up with faith from my parents. I don't think I have any undesirable attributes; I don't smoke or drink, I'm educated, I'm friendly, healthy, in employment, always have time for my family and friends, a well balanced person you might say.

Has anybody else been in this situation?

I've started reading the Qur'an to find answers, but maybe it is the old saying ""all things good come to an end"" eventually. What a shame if that's what this will come to in another 6 months...

I get angry very easily, and I easily misplace things a lot, because I'm a little careless, but today, for a second day in a row, I couldn't go out and do something I enjoy (biking to work), because I misplaced something I needed for the ride.

33lffk,"The foundation of self-control is trust. Parents who are responsive to children's needs foster trust. When the hungry infant wakes up crying and the parent picks him up and feeds him, he learns to trust that food will come. Every time he's soothed, his brain strengthens the neural pathways to soothe anxiety and regulate emotions, which will eventually allow him to soothe himself.

Eventually, this child will trust that he will indeed get the marshmallow eventually, so he doesn't have to eat it this minute. And he'll be able to soothe his own jangly nerves to manage himself in any situation. Parents help their children reach this relatively mature stage faster every time they soothe anxiety and foster a feeling of safety and acceptance.

Not surprisingly, when the Marshmallow test is manipulated so that the child has more trust in the experimenter, the child is able to wait longer to eat the marshmallow. When the child has less trust in the experimenter, he eats the marshmallow sooner. Wouldn't you?

2v9pdy,"Seriously need some relationship advice OK guys I've never posted here, so sorry to the mods if this doesn't belong here.
Second, This is a long one, so buckle up.
Alright so here's a brief summary of me: I'm an almost 21 year old male who still lives with his parents for economic reasons while putting myself through college. I'm in school for History education with a minor in coaching. I'm a bigger guy (around 5'10"", 270), and not horribly attractive.
Now to my situation. I work at Chick-fil-a, which is a fantastic job. One of the perks of working there is that there are plenty of very likeable girls that work there as well. Enter the 4 girls in question. Lets call them Mari, MayRuth, Falicia, and Ally.
Mari is a very real girl. She's arguably the most attractive physically of the group, and I've had a crush on her for a while. She isn't exactly the most intellectually stimulating of the group to have a conversation with, but she is a genuinely nice girl, and extremely attractive in a ""girl next door"" kind of way.
MayRuth is slightly older than me (22), and I just recently noticed my attraction to her. She is very focused on what she wants to do with her life and is currently auditioning for Music graduate programs. She is slightly socially awkward, but I find it adorable.
Falicia is the youngest (18) and is very interesting to try and explain. She's the kind of girl who will say something about her grandmother who passed away today and it not cause her to lose an ounce of her happiness (not an exaggeration, this happened today). She goes out of her way to hug me, and I have never seen her without a smile on her face.
Ally is the girl that I've been crushing on the longest, and she is the most down to earth and real girl of the entire group. We seem to share a good amount of the same interests, and we currently have a class together in addition to working together as well.
I had an opportunity to go bowling with all of them recently, and it was then that I realized that I was crushing on all four of them, and my mind does its usual ""I'm going to over think this into oblivion and put you in a position where you know less than you did before"" thing. The thing is that, I find myself pretty much equally attracted to these girls, and I'm not sure if any of them would even give me the time of day when it comes to relationship type things.
I don't want to risk hurting any feelings over this, and I don't know 1) if any of them like me or 2) if i legitimately have a shot with any of them
We're relatively jovial at work, and I talked to all 4 of them a good bit while bowling with them the other day.
So, Reddit, there's my situation. Maybe I'm coming across like a whiny teenager, but I am legitimately horrible with women. I've had 1 serious relationship my entire life, and we started dating on a silly little joke. I have no idea how to present myself in a way that isn't completely off putting or weird. And I certainly don't know how to approach a woman about serious relationship things.
tl;dr I'm a complete goober who is crushing for 4 girls and have no idea what to do about it.

2u5ujt,"I don't want to lose my friend. Help? Hi. I'm here to ask you lovely redditors advice on my long-standing problem with my best friend. I am a male in 11th grade, as is he. I met him in 6th grade, and while we didn't talk much, we were quite fond of each other. We really started talking a lot before the beginning of high school (9th grade), because not many people from our middle school were zoned to go to the high school that we were zoned for. Anyways, we began to bond a lot more and we ended up being very close. I really treasure and love this friendship, and it's one that's extremely near and dear to my heart. Unfortunately, I'm very confused about my sexuality, but one thing that I was confused about at the end of 10th grade was that I had a full-blown crush on this kid. I made the stupid (or was it not stupid?) decision to tell him. I couldn't bottle it in for longer than 2 months. I've just never really felt that things have been the same ever since. He was of course accepting and kind about telling me and my sexuality and all, but it would be awkward in his position to find out randomly that one of his closest friends liked him more than he thought they did. Anyways, things were okay until 3 months later. He said he needed a break from me, which I now understand is healthy for any friendship, but it really showed me how terrible of a friend I had been. I was very obsessive, clingy, and worst of all, invasive. I fought for our friendship, and sure enough, we were back to normal in 3 weeks. Unfortunately, a couple months later, I got fed up with him. He wouldn't take me seriously, answer me honestly, and I was beyond done when he outright said that he was ignoring a really long and heartfelt message that I sent (which, I later found out, was a joke), and so I had to take a break from him. After a week, we were back to normal. Things have been a lot better between the two of us, but they've never been the same. I want to know how to help him open up to me, how to make it comfortable for him to be around me, or just any advice in general to get things back to the way they were.

2wagsy,"Trembling or shaking? Hey, first time posting on this sub reddit. I was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder when I was young along with clinical depression. I find it has its ups and downs but their comes very specific situations where my body starts to shake or tremble uncontrollably. Does this ever happen to anyone else? It's been awhile and its pretty rare. Most commonly happens when I see my father about once or twice a year. My parents split and as I got older in my teen years (22 now) I stopped seeing him due to having a weekend part time job and him living 2 hours out of the city. I only see him on a occasion now and while he does nothing to intimidate me and is usually pretty friendly I can't help but shake.

(This actually isn't all that recent...I've had this feeling for a while now). I find myself overthinking small situations that other people don't seem to worry about. I create hypothetical situations in my mind. I then stress over the fact that I do these things. I find it hard to have conversations with people I don't know well, or am not comfortable around. I worry that I'm saying the wrong thing or that I'm making too much eye contact, and then worry that they can tell that I'm doing these things. This is the biggest issue for me, and leads to huge feelings of inadequacy, even though in most cases I haven't done anything wrong. I also find comfort in routine, not obsessively, but for example...I perform the same routine, in the same order every morning when I get ready for work. If I don't have time to do what I need to do, I feel stressed, but it wouldn't necessarily ruin my day.

2psuv5,"Needing to vent... Hi everyone.  I just got out of a one and a half year relationship on Monday that was emotionally abusive and incredibly damaging to my self-esteem. The abuse started subtle, with helpful advice about how I could be a ""better person"" or a ""better mother to my children"". I wanted to do just about anything I could that he asked of me, so I tried to change.  I tried every time he asked me for something else, I gave away more and more of myself to please him.  He conditioned me to fear the words ""I Love you"" because it was so often followed by ""but.."" and something I'd done wrong. The cops were called out multiple times over our fighting, but I would always insist I was fine. He would go on drunken rants, calling me every name you could think of. He threw a lit cigarette at me, ripped the blanket off of me while I slept, slammed me into a wall, and I always was left feeling responsible. Towards the end, we were drinking 7 days a week, missing work all the time, and fighting so much that I sent my kids away to live with their father.  I got out, moved a few states away, and almost let him talk me back into flying back to him so we could get sober together, as he told me I was not what my children needed the way I was and that he could help me now that I'd shown him he was an alcoholic and needed to change.  He made a point of putting long, drawn out amends on his facebook, tagging everyone he may have wronged in the past, talking about how much he wants to change for them.  It all looked so good and sounded so promising.  I foolishly asked if I would be getting one, and was told that my amends would depend on whether or not I came back. He said he could hopefully one day forgive my leaving him, and we could work past it. On the day of my flight, I canceled. I no longer wanted to feel the way I let myself feel around him and because of him. The loving words he'd been feeding me since I left were gone, replaced with name calling, threats to have my children taken away from me, and ended with him telling me to kill myself before I do any more damage to my kids. His long,drawn out amends to me detailed every perceived slight against him, painting himself as a martyr in nearly every one.  He even went into explicit detail about a rape situation I was in, for his entire friends list to see.  

I've blocked him, cut off contact, but we share so many mutual friends still and had built up a life together.  I'm feeling so alone right now, because I lost all my friends I had before him.  Our mutual friends are tired of the drama between us.  I'm just glad I found others that can understand the emptiness I'm feeling.  The guilt, and the blame I've piled on myself.  Whew.

One of the things that's been really hard to change...  is that it's hard for me to sleep next to a partner.  The more I care about him and trust him, the scarier it is.  I trusted my ex, too...  And it was just shattering to try so hard to leave my heart open every day to someone who may or may not abuse it.  And he hated to acknowledge it; I could never take time to heal because he was watching all of the time, trying to make sure my mask of happiness never slipped.  The only time I ever had to myself was after he had fallen asleep, when I could cry or even frown without being yelled at.  

But it's been years...  And it kills me that I haven't gotten over it.  I have a wonderful partner who would never do any of that.  And I still stay up at night sometimes worrying about how his hands might betray me, or if I do get to sleep quickly I get nightmares.  But I found something that helps!  I asked him to touch my face when I'm scared.  When he knows I'm having a bad night he doesn't even have to wake up to help.  I just need the contact.  And after awhile I can already tell the difference!  I'm learning new habits of falling asleep happy instead of scared and miserable.  I'm learning to associate the hands of the man I love with comfort and peace instead of fear.  With his help, I'm literally training my brain out of it.  It's working!

I feel like with things like this, it's really hard sometimes to feel like you're getting anywhere, you know?  Dealing with those long-term symptoms is such a process that you often can't pinpoint milestones to celebrate, just bad stuff to get down on yourself for.  So if you'd care to join me for a celebration:  What victories in healing have y'all had?  Getting free, learning how to recognize your abuse for what it was, taking little parts of your life back?  I'm just digging the positivity of taking a while to focus on that.

2tc7b3,"[Help] Having a hard time at work because anxiety keeps me up at night and I'm so tired every day. I made a big post a few days ago about my whole story with anxiety:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/2t4qxn/help_anxiety_is_starting_to_interfere_with/

I was managing and hardly missing any work due to anxiety before Christmas, but I got 2 whole weeks of holidays (I work in real estate and it's a slow time anyway, plus my boss goes away for 6 weeks at Christmas), and things went downhill after that. 

I came back to the office the 5th-7th, but the night of the 7th I had a major anxiety attack and barely slept. I stayed home Thursday and Friday, and by the weekend I had a really bad cold. The cold kept me home from work for the 12th-14th, and I came into the office on the 15th for 4 hours. That was a bit too much because I felt worse on the 16th and stayed home that day as well. 

I felt mostly better after last weekend (having a hard time kicking this cold completely, probably partly because of lack of sleep), and was back at work on Monday in the afternoon. Monday night I had bad anxiety again and barely slept, and stayed home on Tuesday because I wasn't feeling well again. 

I've made it to work yesterday and today, but I'm having such a hard time focusing because I'm so tired. I feel like I could close my eyes for 5 minutes and fall asleep. It doesn't help that the only work I have to do right now is very monotonous editing of webpages - I've been working on this almost daily for the last 6 months, and I've only completed about 175 of them. My boss wanted me to have them all done by the time he got back, but I'm nowhere near done - I have about 425 to go yet. 

He's a pretty understanding boss, and he's been really good to me as I've been struggling with this for the last few months. But I'm nervous to tell him that these aren't even close to being done yet, and very anxious about his reaction/what he's going to do. But even if I hadn't been sick, and had worked my butt off on my vacation, I still don't think they would be done. I think it was an unrealistic goal for us to set, and I'm so anxious about it. 

This lack of sleep is really getting to me. I got some melatonin yesterday and took it last night, and I still had a hard time falling asleep, but I only woke up once after I was asleep, which is good! 

I've tried everything I can think of to get more/better sleep - cutting out caffeine, drinking lots of water, eating better, playing soothing music at night, using lavender body mist/pillow mist/oil, going to bed earlier, and now taking melatonin - and I'm at my wit's end. It's so frustrating to not be able to sleep properly, because it totally screws with the rest of your life. 

Does anyone have any tips? tricks? advice? feedback? I'm going to see my doctor on Monday, and a nurse friend of mine recommended having blood work, etc. done to check my hormones and thyroid to see if there's any issues there. I also have a meeting for the first week of February with a behavioural health consultant.

This has arisen from the last few years of being a thinker and wondering and appreciating the universe. But just saying feels like ""no way"" you could never!

Everyone knows this, even the people who do it, but do you think the way the NFL handled this situation was wrong too? In my opinion, this all seems like the NFL is only coming down so hard on him because of the medias response. I mean, there was a statement saying that he hit his fiance, a video of her getting dragged out of an elevator while being unconscious, and he only got a 2 game suspension, and the public kind of looked over it. However, once this video of what happened inside the elevator gets released, everyone freaks out and the NFL is forced to say, ""whoops, actually you're banned forever."" Now, I understand that, obviously, no man should ever hit a woman, but no woman should ever hit a man either, (unless circumstances require it) but is this personal issue something that he should lose any chance of playing in the NFL, something he worked his whole life to achieve, over? I feel like there should be a lot more focus on how the court is going to handle this, not the NFL. Yet, I do understand the progressiveness in making an example out of him.

The big thing is he refuses to talk about things and always makes himself the victim and he guilts me and makes me feel like I'm walking on shrapnel but when he isn't like that he's really sweet.

1j57fc,"I have a hate/love relationship with my anger and I want to know how to get rid of it. I have had a problem with my anger for a long time now. One of my major problems has been not letting my anger out in healthy ways. I usually only let my anger out when I get really pissed off and I know this sounds dumb, but I feel like the incredible hulk when I get angry in that I feel like my body transforms into this monster that I can't control. My biggest problem with this is that I love the rush of pure energy my body gets when I feel like this. My most recent spike was today. I'm only 17 and I get into fights almost every time I talk with my sister. She was annoying me and we got into an altercation where I fought her. She said I needed to be put on Ritalin and called me a psychopath (Her minor in college is child psychology so she told me all about how messed up I am even though I have been seeing a therapist for about a month now) and this is where I really lost it. My father had to step between us and then I started to fight with him. I felt like I had ""transformed"" into this monster as I wrestled my father who I have never taken down before, to the ground. I could feel the rush of energy in my arms and hands as I saw my veins pulse. I got back up and looked at my sister and I felt like I was going to kill her. She ended up leaving the house because she had called my mother to pick her up ad she is staying at my mother's for the rest of the summer. This is probably the biggest spike of anger/energy/adrenaline I have ever had and it felt good, but the repercussions of my actions are what make my anger bad. I don't know what my anger stems from and I don't like it, but I love the energy I get from it.

2wuopj,"What's the point of trying? I have so much anxiety, agoraphobia, OCD, that everything I try to do is a chore. 

It's hard to make myself get out of bed because I dread the feeling of it being a beginning of another day of pain and suffering. 

I've been on every drug and therapy that has been thrown at me. My parents and friends have gotten so sick and tired of me being this way that they don't even bother helping anymore.  I don't blame them. Why should they waste their love and time and resources on someone who will never get better. 

I already know I'm going to get responses like 'oh it will get better' etc. But that doesn't help me. 

I've gone through so many cycles of trying to get better, trying to get a job again.  Every day is a struggle and even when I'm 'doing well' I hate my life and wish I could just stay confined to my room and numb myself with video games, or a book, a hobby, or pot.

I would do anything to separate my overactive mind from myself. Being in this constant state of dread is miserable. I'm only happy when I feel like I have no deadlines, no priorities, no lingering problems on the horizon. 

But society tells me that I need a job. I need friends. I need family. I need to go outside. I need to socialize.  What if I don't want these things?  Does that make me a loser?  Does it make me a lazy person?  I'm afraid of being labeled lazy, but I have failed so many times after working SO hard to try to keep a job. 

I just wish I could have a job and tell my boss that waking up and coming into work in the morning isn't the same for me like everybody else. It is facing my biggest fear every single morning. I don't know how I keep it up for weeks at a time, but when I eventually get fired for callouts or no shows, it just reinforces the fact that I'm not normal and I'm never going to be happy in the world that everyone else expects me to take part in..

Is anxiety a lie?  Or is it personality?  I mean, I DEFINITELY have panic attacks and agoraphobia etc. But my mind is hyperactive. I'm always thinking a mile a minute. 

I think I was born in the wrong century. Any other time and I'd probably be a cooky shaman or philosopher or something. But people can't exist like that today. You are expected to live a life of drudgery and 9-5 misery. I can't do it....  

My big fear is being labeled as lazy, when I'm anything but. I think work is important, but I can't commit to rigid schedules. And the concept of money to me is terrifying. I worry about money all the time. I wish the world was different but I can't change the world. 

After having the worst bout of panic attacks and agoraphobia yet, I finally had to take government assistance (food stamps and medicare).  I feel guilty that I'm leeching off of 'hard working Americans'. I respect the people who can do it. The people who can work a full week every week and I understand that I'm literally feeding myself off their hard work.

2idej8,"Became good friends with a survivor, looking for advice.[Possible Trigger Warning] I recently befriended a first year girl at college. We became good friends after some long middle of the night conversations on facebook, but slowly I started to develop a crush on her that has gotten pretty serious by now. I told her, and although she doesn't feel the same way, she's okay with working on it together and staying good friends. 

I care a lot about her, and since she has shown to be struggling with an abusive childhood I want to do the right thing. List of details I've found so far:
-Father was really abusive, this led to a divorce with her mother. An example of his bahaviour would be putting spiders in her clothes to get her over her fear of spiders. (which needless to say provided quite the opposite result) I don't expect anything sexual. She has not seen him since the divorce, even moved to a diffrent country. This is quite a few years in the past.
-Mother was not really abusive(according to her), but really a tough love kind of person. Focussing a lot on her daughters schoolwork, but forgetting there's more to a kid than school. She missed birthdays and high school graduation. 

She is suffering under this past. problems include, but are not limited to:
-Insomnia
-Nightmares
-Difficulty to process emotions
-Trust issues.
-Very hesitant to almost every form of touch with anybody.
-Not wanting to have children, simply for fearing she might abuse them.
-Very low self esteem.
-Saying about herself that she's a bad person.

I would love to help her in any way shape or form, but I do not know what to do. She herself wants to ignore it, bury it, and is not open to any other options. However, seeing as she is clearly struggling, I would do anything to help her cope. Genuine and honest compliments do not seem to get through to her in any way, and I'm not able to convince her that she's a good person.

2goa17,"Should we suspect sexual abuse, or is this paranoia? Thank you so so much for any help or perspective you can offer...

My dad was physically and emotionally abusive and would never let us cry lest someone hear and ""mistakenly"" think he was abusing us and was a bad father. He would throw things at me, call me a bitch, ignore me for weeks on end with total non recognition for crimes such as failing to bring his tea on time, etc. Even if we were injured he would not let us show distress in public and said we were disgracing ourselves.

My sister and I have memories of him coming into our rooms at night and of being extremely frightened when this happened. We always closed our eyes and pretended to be asleep and after awhile he would go away. Once after a screaming fight with my mother he stormed up the stairs, ran into my sister's room, and tore off the covers. She was naked and as usual pretended to be asleep. He stared at her for a very long time and went away. I can think of no explanation that makes this normal. I have a vague early memory of touching his crotch but no context. We both have a feeling of fear and suspicion but no clue how justified.

2xsoy2,"Forgiveness and letting go I was watching an episode of *Hoarders* yesterday - it motivates me to clean my house - and one of the hoarders was talking about letting go; letting go of the stuff, letting go of the meaning she attached to that stuff, letting go of her pain.

I've talked a lot about how it's not forgiveness but acceptance, of letting go, that is the real key to healing and recovery.  And thinking about the show, I thought ""Interesting how no one is telling her to forgive her stuff before she can let it go and heal"" but obviously I know that people and things are not the same.  

But this morning I was reading [Tips and Resources for Parenting in Survival Mode](http://www.toddlerapproved.com/2015/03/tips-and-resources-for-parenting-in.html) and was struck by how lowering expectations is really about letting go, of unclenching, of accepting what you cannot change.

And I thought ""Interesting how we would never tell a mother in 'survival mode' that she needs to forgive her children""; obviously they are kids, doing exactly what kids do, in an environment shaped and controlled by everyone else.

So why is the relationship between an abuser and victim so different that our society utterly *demands* the victim 'forgive' their abuser - really, they are demanding reconciliation and absolution - insisting that healing can only happen once the victim has forgiven their abuser.  Generally speaking, we don't as a culture tell the families of murder victims that forgiving the murderer is the only way they can heal.

It's interesting to me that we have such high expectations for mothers that when they violate those expectations, we then have high expectations for their children to forgive them.  (As with fathers, as with other family members.)  We can see how the family relationship takes precedence, because if anyone else treated a stranger that way it would be ""assault"", it would be ""rape"", it would be ""torture""; not ""abuse"", ""sexual abuse"" or ""molestation"", or ""abuse"".

Is there the same pressure on a victim to forgive the abuser if that abuser was a romantic partner?  I know there is a lot of pressure to 'make a marriage work', for example, but I don't actually know if the social pressure to 'forgive' is the same for someone who has been victimized in a romantic relationship.

Edit: 

I remember a sermon where the minister talked about how he needed to forgive his puppy for pooping in the kitchen so that the minister could let go of his anger and move on.  And I thought it was absolutely fucking ridiculous; the dog is a puppy, doing what puppies do, in an environment shaped and controlled by the minister.  Like that's how far we've taken 'forgiveness' when, in this particular instance, it was more about appropriate expectations, understanding what you can control, and letting go.

Appropriate expectations, understanding what you can control, and letting go is the most helpful for healing.  None of which actually requires forgiveness.

Edit:

It is clear to me that forgiveness is about *preserving relationships*, not healing.  And I believe that it is *up to the victim* to decide if they want to preserve that relationship, and if it is in their best interest.  (And that a precursor to 'forgiveness' should be making amends and/or restitution on the part of the abuser.)",abuse,"['forgiveness', 'letting', 'go', 'watching', 'episode', 'hoarders', 'yesterday', 'motivates', 'clean', 'house', 'one', 'hoarders', 'talking', 'letting', 'go', 'letting', 'go', 'stuff', 'letting', 'go', 'meaning', 'attached', 'stuff', 'letting', 'go', 'pain', 'talked', 'lot', 'forgiveness', 'acceptance', 'letting', 'go', 'real', 'key', 'healing', 'recovery', 'thinking', 'show', 'thought', 'interesting', 'one', 'telling', 'forgive', 'stuff', 'let', 'go', 'heal', 'obviously', 'know', 'people', 'things', 'morning', 'reading', 'tips', 'resources', 'parenting', 'survival', 'mode', 'http', 'www', 'toddlerapproved', 'com', 'tips', 'resources', 'parenting', 'html', 'struck', 'lowering', 'expectations', 'really', 'letting', 'go', 'unclenching', 'accepting', 'change', 'thought', 'interesting', 'would', 'never', 'tell', 'mother', 'urvival', 'mode', 'needs', 'forgive', 'children', 'obviously', 'kids', 'exactly', 'kids', 'environment', 'shaped', 'controlled', 'everyone', 'else', 'relationship', 'abuser', 'victim', 'different', 'society', 'utterly', 'demands', 'victim', 'forgive', 'abuser', 'really', 'demanding', 'reconciliation', 'absolution', 'insisting', 'healing', 'happen', 'victim', 'forgiven', 'abuser', 'generally', 'speaking', 'culture', 'tell', 'families', 'murder', 'victims', 'forgiving', 'murderer', 'way', 'heal', 'interesting', 'high', 'expectations', 'mothers', 'violate', 'expectations', 'high', 'expectations', 'children', 'forgive', 'fathers', 'family', 'members', 'see', 'family', 'relationship', 'takes', 'precedence', 'anyone', 'else', 'treated', 'stranger', 'way', 'would', 'assault', 'would', 'rape', 'would', 'torture', 'abuse', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'molestation', 'abuse', 'pressure', 'victim', 'forgive', 'abuser', 'abuser', 'romantic', 'partner', 'know', 'lot', 'pressure', 'make', 'marriage', 'work', 'example', 'actually', 'know', 'social', 'pressure', 'forgive', 'someone', 'victimized', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'edit', 'remember', 'sermon', 'minister', 'talked', 'needed', 'forgive', 'puppy', 'pooping', 'kitchen', 'minister', 'could', 'let', 'go', 'anger', 'move', 'thought', 'absolutely', 'fucking', 'ridiculous', 'dog', 'puppy', 'puppies', 'environment', 'shaped', 'controlled', 'minister', 'like', 'far', 'taken', 'forgiveness', 'particular', 'instance', 'appropriate', 'expectations', 'understanding', 'control', 'letting', 'go', 'appropriate', 'expectations', 'understanding', 'control', 'letting', 'go', 'helpful', 'healing', 'none', 'actually', 'requires', 'forgiveness', 'edit', 'clear', 'forgiveness', 'preserving', 'relationships', 'healing', 'believe', 'victim', 'decide', 'want', 'preserve', 'relationship', 'best', 'interest', 'precursor', 'forgiveness', 'making', 'amends', 'restitution', 'part', 'abuser']"

2vi91b,"Been dealing with STD anxieties (specifically HIV). Can't function...please help me I met with a guy last week Sunday (I am also a guy), and I gave him a handjob for the remainder of the hook up. I stupidly went down on him for about two minutes-3 min tops. He did not ejaculate in my mouth, but there might have been some precum. I kept pulling out his dick throughout the whole ordeal. I have been mental this whole weekend waiting for the window periods. This guy probably has had a lot of sexual partners. In 2013, he received a kidney transplant because he was born premature. He basically told me that his doctor keeps tabs on him. He gets medication monthly. I found his instagram account, so I know he was not lying about the surgery. 6 hours prior to the hook up, I brushed a bit hard and there was some bleeding. I hope that the wound healed, I am so fucking scared. This guy is a social guy, and drinks with friends and stuff. 

On Saturday, I started feeling a weird sensation in my throat. I still can feel it, but it is not as bad as Saturday. I couldn't enjoy my mini family vacation :(  I was basically at risk for Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, and HIV, and the exposure frightens me. 

I've even made an account on POZ.com, and the admins have all told me that I didn't have a risk. My friend, who is a sexual health educator, basically scolded me because my world is ending just because I sucked a dick. Though, he understands my anxiety because he was like me. 

I can't eat much, but thankfully I can sleep. Sleeping is the only way I can soothe my body and mind from anxiety. I feel stupid, and I just want to die.

1eo8n7,"Childhood sexual abuse survivor...finding the courage to tell others my story I took a course in college about child abuse, and it triggered every memory of my abuse that I repressed after it happened when I was 4 years old. I always knew there was something weird about my childhood, but it was when I started reading the chapter in the textbook about sexual abuse and how children react in every day life that was a slap in the face. It happened at a daycare that I used to go to. It was an in-home daycare and my abuser was the son of the people who ran it. After he would abuse me he would make me sit under one of those plastic bucket things with the rope handles, and he would then sit on it and trap me for as long as he felt was necessary. His dad would also beat me with a belt and shut me in bedrooms in the house for long periods of time.

It took me about a year and a half and a very supportive boyfriend to find the courage to seek counseling to deal with all of the residual depression/anxiety/stress. We are working on healthy touching so that I can re-establish my sexuality on my own terms.

Along with counseling, I thought Reddit would be the perfect place to reach out for support from other survivors. I may feel alone a lot, but I know that I am absolutely not alone in my journey. Thanks for reading and I hope to hear from you :)

At home with my SO though is totally different. The littlest things can make me flip out and I've been trying hard to control those by just channeling them through the proper channels (e.g. if my SO does something insignificant that hurt me, I get in a sad mood for a while about it) instead of channeling it through rage. But there are still times when something will happen to trigger the ""hulk"" rage and I can't stop. I get detached emotionally (aside from anger) and I feel like I don't know who I am or what I'm saying anymore.

11xwno,"Survival mode: why I feel I cannot be helped It doesn't matter what plan I make or how I resolve to do better next time, whether it's some new mindset or some reminder object, my rage cannot be helped and here is why.

First of all, once anger has set in, all rational thoughts are gone. I now *want* to be mad. Any reminder of past thinking seems silly because this is currently justified in my mind.

Second, I'm in fight or flight mode. Tiny annoyances and frustrations for some reason trigger adrenaline and stress responses in me. My stress level is always high and I am in a state of hyper-vigilance daily, so going into ""oh shit a Tiger!"" mode happens as easily as being cut off in traffic or fumbling with autocorrect.

For these reasons I do not believe any counseling or meditation or anger management will ever help without some kind of chemical change.

Yes, I believe I need some sort is medication to drop me out of this super stress survival mode so that it doesn't keep engaging into uncontrolled rampages. However I don't know what such a thing would be. I have read that SSRIs are only fighting the symptom of the stress problem, low serotonin, but not curbing the stress glands and hormones themselves.

I was better at not exploding but I snarked a lot and internalized a great deal of stress.

About a year ago a friend suggested I try vitamin D.  I was in an unusually receptive mood so I took the daily dosage and noticed an almost immediate improvement in my SAD.  Doubtful, I started A/B testing - go off for a couple of days to see how I feel, go back.  There's no question in my mind now, it's a huge influence.

Lately I've started taking a B12, which seems to have relieved my anger.  I just... don't get upset.  I know the things out there are still *so wrong* but I'm not compelled emotionally to do anything about it.  Maybe it's more accurate to say that I notice things that *would* have pissed me off and my lack of anger surprises me a little.

Vitamin C, on the other hand, I can't take.  I have fruit with breakfast.  I found that if I have a vitamin C and an orange in the morning I become angry during the day.

I'm probably only getting these one every week but when I do they are pretty unpleasant and have a duration of at least an hour, with the after effects lasting up to three. Although in a way that's kinda bad but I understand it could be worst. The main thing that is affecting me is the constant worry that one will hit at any second, I have a physical feeling all around my body that one is immanent constantly. It's keeping me, in a way, constantly terrified. I'm scared of driving, using the computer, drinking coffee, laying down, talking to family, socialising in environments over 1-1, taking medication for a recent head trauma, playing video games, just basically anything that could increase heart rate or cause slight emotional tension.

Because I'm in the UK the next time I can try to book an appointment with my GP is Monday, is there any guides in the meantime which can help reduce these effects? And on a second note do you think what I've described seems severe enough to be medicated, or would something like CBT be enough to take this issue in a hopefully quick manor.

Thanks for the time you've taken to read this, and I really appreciate any comments or input anyone could contribute. Sorry for being so needy, I'm just a little out of options right now.

l8rzr,"Angry after abuse Long time lurker, first time poster (with throwaway). 

I am a 23 year old female, I have been out of abuse for almost three years now. I started therapy while I was in the abusive relationship (I knew it was toxic and I was trying to get out) and maintained the therapy for 2 years after. 

The first boyfriend (lasted less than 6 months) I had post abuse went terribly because I was so angry, mean, and terribly disturbed. I was still in therapy at this time so I thought I had worked through being angry in new relationships.

I am now in a relationship that has been going on seriously for about 3-4 months now. He knows about the abuse and made some very minor mistakes in the beginning of the relationship that triggered old feelings and I've been very angry with him ever since. He told me today that he thinks I am a very mean person. I've known this to be true since my abuse, but to hear someone say it really broke my heart. I have been told all of my life how nice I am to people and to know that I have turned into this hateful monster is destroying me, and consequently making me even angrier. 

I don't want to be this way. I am so angry and distrustful and I don't know what my other options are after therapy and anger management. I don't want to keep hurting innocent people.

2vnbj8,"[Help] Feeling sick and panicky when it's time for school, need tips. When I wake up in the morning at 6:30, I stay in my bed to finish waking up. I then look at the clock and that's usually when my anxiety kicks in for whatever reason and I realize it's time for the thing I dread. I'm an introvert, so I feel an energy drain talking to people. My energy drains just thinking about talking to people. I think about teachers calling on me in the classes I have trouble understanding in or calling me out for doing something wrong on a quiz, assignment, or test. I think about having to be bored for most of the day. I think about my classmates looking at me because I'm late like usual and my 1st hour teacher commenting on it. 

I would like to change this. I can't stay home whenever I want. I rarely stay home actually. I've been late nearly every day this year. At times, up to 2 hours late. That's because my sister leaves at that time and I have no options. 

I am thinking about just doing school online and that makes me calm. It goes away fast though, considering my mind comes back to public school. I know that homeschool would probably be a bad idea in terms of social relationships and stuff. It's a really comforting idea for me though.

I don't know how to deal with this aspect of my anxiety. I've done fairly well managing it over these few years I've been around.

I have also pieced together that I then turned around and did this abuse to others, but not past my adolescence.  I've been told it wasn't malicious but I just didn't know it was ""wrong"".  Enter the extreme guilt, shame, and depression.  It constantly gnaws at me, and looking back I've been depressed most of my life, I assume the trigger for it was the abuse.

After a failed suicide attempt in college I was diagnosed with PTSD, but didn't continue therapy because it was too costly.

It was just awful, but I got medication and by the time I was 13 I was totally anxiety free. Now I continued this way until senior year in high school. I had a week where I couldn't bring myself to get on the bus to go to school. It was weird, but I managed to get through it without much of an issue. 
Now I'm 22 and my anxiety is as bad as it was when I was 11. I stopped taking my medication back when I was 18 and from then on it wasn't an issue. I did more things out of my comfort zone, I saw places I hadn't seen, I wasn't afraid of much. But now it's just so severe. Last August I had cut out caffeine, smoking, and worked on being healthier. I'm underweight as it is, but I wanted to exercise and get into good shape. But since I cut everything out, and even a little while before then. My anxiety has been slowly making its way back, and at this point I don't imagine it could get much worse. Which is good and bad for me. I'm not worried about things getting worse for me and my sanity, but I know that this is crippling my life and making me a difficult person to be around.

She has been kind of critical of me since my anxiety became an issue. When we fight it's definitely worse. I honestly think that has something to do with it. If we don't fight I have generally decent days, still anxious, but not as bad in comparison. We have a lot of bad days together, and I sometimes think I should end it. But her daughter is fantastic and when my gf is happy, things are great. So I think part of it is just the state of my relationship, but it didn't start that way. At least I don't think so anyway.",non_abuse,"['anxiety', 'back', 'used', 'pretty', 'crippling', 'anxiety', 'back', 'stayed', 'school', 'month', 'awful', 'got', 'medication', 'time', 'totally', 'anxiety', 'free', 'continued', 'way', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'week', 'could', 'bring', 'get', 'bus', 'go', 'school', 'weird', 'managed', 'get', 'without', 'much', 'issue', 'anxiety', 'bad', 'stopped', 'taking', 'medication', 'back', 'issue', 'things', 'comfort', 'zone', 'saw', 'places', 'seen', 'afraid', 'much', 'severe', 'last', 'august', 'cut', 'caffeine', 'smoking', 'worked', 'healthier', 'underweight', 'wanted', 'exercise', 'get', 'good', 'shape', 'since', 'cut', 'everything', 'even', 'little', 'anxiety', 'slowly', 'making', 'way', 'back', 'point', 'imagine', 'could', 'get', 'much', 'worse', 'good', 'bad', 'worried', 'things', 'getting', 'worse', 'sanity', 'know', 'crippling', 'life', 'making', 'difficult', 'person', 'around', 'wondering', 'guys', 'ideas', 'brought', 'back', 'life', 'style', 'changed', 'much', 'dating', 'girl', 'year', 'half', 'even', 'living', 'since', 'may', 'kind', 'critical', 'since', 'anxiety', 'became', 'issue', 'fight', 'definitely', 'worse', 'honestly', 'think', 'something', 'fight', 'generally', 'decent', 'days', 'still', 'anxious', 'bad', 'comparison', 'lot', 'bad', 'days', 'together', 'sometimes', 'think', 'end', 'daughter', 'fantastic', 'gf', 'happy', 'things', 'great', 'think', 'part', 'state', 'relationship', 'start', 'way', 'least', 'think', 'anyway']"
2udszs,"I finally caved and agreed to try medication for my anxiety. Any advice on how to use it without becoming addicted? Hi all!  I just found this sub and I couldn't be happier to discover other people struggling with anxiety.  I have struggled with anxiety my entire life and haven't been able to really keep it in check.  I am in my last semester of grad school and I can honestly say I have never been this stressed out in my life.  Top that off with some general living situation and boyfriend issues and I get panic attacks regularly.

Recently, I ended up having a panic attack with chest pains for about 12 hours so I went to my doctor and she prescribed me Lorazepam (ativan).  This stuff is beyond amazing, I was a carefree person for the first time in my life.  As a future social worker, I am well aware of benzos and the effects/addictions they create.  While all the education in the world is great, I was hoping for some real life advice.  As of right now I am only supposed to take them when I feel a panic attack coming, however that is pretty regularly at this point.  How often can I take a pill without becoming addicted?  I have a .5mg prescription.

is8bp,"Verbally/Emotionally Abusive relationship, please help. Female, 19.

I dated my now ex-boyfriend (who is 20, turns 21 in a month) for a year and seven months. After we broke up in October of 2010, I was devastated. A lot of my friends didn't really understand why. They knew that he had been emotionally/verbally abusive and of course knew I was better off, but I never really came to that conclusion until many, many months later. He'd never outright call me fat or ugly, but he definitely found indirect ways to tell me. He even told me, after we'd been broken up for a couple of months, that if I were to have sex with anyone else but him, I'd be a slut. He's the only person I've ever slept with, and we were in a committed relationship for awhile before we started having sex.

I struggled with my self-esteem a lot before I started dating him, but now it's at all all-time low. Everything he used to say burns in the back of my mind. I go to the gym and work out three days a week and do pilates twice a week and try to eat healthy, but I feel like it will never be enough. I'm 5'2'' and 135 pounds. I'm a size 4-6. But it's become an unhealthy obsession to win his approval even though I know I'm never going to get it. I want to be smaller. Lighter. Thinner.

He called me the other day and wanted to talk with me, so we hung out for a bit. He again found ways to call me a slut, and tell me that I'm still not as thin as I could be. I don't understand why I need his approval so badly. Other guys have told me that I have a great body and I'm pretty, but it holds absolutely no weight.

How do I stop this madness? I feel like I'm on a one-way path to self-destruction and I don't know how to stop, only how to slow down or speed up.

I have still been taking care of necessary chores outside the house but it has been *bad*. Really. I'm nauseated when I have to leave the house, IBS flare ups and its not getting any easier.

2qlx72,"My parents keep giving my room to holiday visitors. Basically every time a pair of people stay at our apartment, be it grandparents or my brother and his girlfriend, the expectation is that I give up my room for them to sleep in.  All of my work supplies are stored in my room; all of my recreational activities are stored in my room.  Every time a holiday rolls around, the stress of dealing with this interruption to my schedule hangs over the entire week or so that my room is occupied.  

It affects my thoughts, my mood, and my ability to deal with those in a manner that is non-intrusive to others.  I don't hide how I'm feeling well, so if I'm frustrated, I usually retreat to my room. I can deal with how I'm feeling alone, without bothering anyone else.  When my room gets taken away, I lose my opportunity to compose myself. The only room left in the apartment for me to occupy is the living room, where my frustration is in full view of the world.  The only other unoccupied room during most of the day is my parents bedroom, but I can't get comfortable in there because it has none of the things I usually occupy myself with in it and because eventually I get asked to move out of there so they can go to bed.

I'm not crazy, I understand that my parents are trying to be accommodating for the short time relatives are in town.  I also recognize that this isn't a frequent event, it just usually occurs around holidays which has the side effect of making it very hard for me to enjoy them.  What drives me up the wall is the way they approach my feelings on the subject.  I'm visibly frustrated in the living room? I'm poisoning the atmosphere, I must be trying to make everyone feel guilty about my feelings. I express frustration that something I need is in the room where the visitors are sleeping? Oh well, you knew this was going to happen, you should've prepared better.  

I don't know what these people expect, I've been dealing with depression for months, and they seem to be shocked when my space that I use to process what I'm feeling so I don't ""impose"" on others is taken away.  They say shit like ""for this week, that room isn't yours"". Bitch please! The implication that my room, which is filled with my belongings, and which I occupy 100% of the time when we have no guests, stops being mine for any period of time because someone else is using the bed is utterly insulting.

But no, I'm the crazy one for arguing that point. 

My hospitality has limits. Giving up my room might be slightly easier if I got the sense that the sacrifice was viewed as a favor offered by me rather than a gift offered by my parents.  It might be easier if the whole matter was treated as a request made to me, rather than a concession expected of me.  It might be easier I got the sense that they at least tried to empathize with how giving of my room really affected me.

But no, I get treated like a child.  ""Fine, you can have your room for one more night while your brother's girlfriend hasn't arrived yet"", as if getting my room for one more night fixes everything.  I don't want small token gestures to placate me.  I want some sense that the stress this causes me is justified and respectable.

2yvaul,"""Don't Come Home With Your Panties On Backwards!"" (trigger warning) This was what my mom said on many occasions when I'd leave the house on the weekends at 18.

What she didn't know is that this guy was repeatedly molesting me but I was too scared to say or do anything about it. She still doesn't know and it's been almost six years. She hates my current boyfriend but he's helped me get over a lot of the problems I had (mentally) because of what happened.  
I don't really have a point with this, I just needed to get it off my chest because I've been thinking about it a lot.

2unp58,"How do I help my brother with severe social anxiety disorder? My brother who is 20, two years younger than me has SEVERE social anxiety disorder.

He barely leaves the house, cannot go out into public without almost having a panic attack, can't order food at fast food joints, he responds (even to me) with one word replies. Very, very shy. 

This is going to affect everything in his life, his relationships, his work experience, everything.

He's never had a job. Never had a girlfriend. Quit school few years early though he got his diploma through online-learning. 

He has seen a psychiatrist and psychologist before, but stopped going after being prescribed clonazepam and doing nothing but sitting in his room playing video games 24/7, zombified. 

I think the reason he did this was because we live in the middle of nowhere, literally. The nearest town is 30km away and is only 7000 people large. He has nothing here for him, and the specialists suck. One psychiatrist for the whole damn town.

He's been on antidepressants before, they did nothing. But he's only tried one. Clonazepam worked, but after a while he started abusing his medication and taking high doses every day. He got off of that and has been off for about a year. 

What can I do, as his older brother? I'm trying to get my life sorted out, I'm almost in the same position as him, I just don't have SAD though I do have GAD/bipolar, but that's another story. I feel though as a brother I have to take care of him, because my Mother has tried helping him but she gives up at this point.

*We just don't know what to do.*

I asked him last night if he would consider going to a psychiatrist again and do therapy/go on meds again. He said ""maybe"" which I wasn't really satisfied with as an answer. I know I gotta be patient with him.

He seems severely depressed and does nothing but play video games all day. Hardly ever showers. Has a poor diet, but he's had that forever. He's super skinny, I mean skelly skinny. I don't want him to live a life like this forever due to his disorder. If Mom died, he would have nothing except me. 

So, how can I help him? Get him outside more? Do things with him? Encourage him to see a psychiatrist again? This has got to stop eventually because I fear someday he will end up killing himself because I know he does not like how things are heading for him.

So at the moment I called my psych 3 days ago and asked if I could talk to him about my Prozac, finally the next day the nurse said to stop taking it and she would call in Paxil for me.

I go to Walgreens and they said I can't have it because I of a drug interaction with the tredazone.

116io4,"Some sort of post traumatic stress after a few years of physical abuse...advice? I'll try to make this short. I just discovered this subreddit, so I am hopefully not violating any rules.

I dated a guy for about three years. He started physically abusing me early on to the point of nearly killing me. Nobody knew about this physical abuse. Very few people do even now. I still have this sense of shame about all of it. The shame now stems from more of ""How could I have been so stupid?""

It's kind of therapeutic to talk about it, even to strangers. It was the classic cycle of abuse. I thought he would stop. I always thought it wouldn't happen again. Well, one day he finally punched me in front of his mom and aunt. That was my last straw. I realized that if he could do this in front of others and have no remorse...he could do anything.

It was really hard and scary to leave, but I did it and I'm proud.

Therapy is not really an option right now because I don't have the means. I wish I did. I don't really have anybody to talk to this about or relate to.

I don't believe I have some full-blown PTSD, but I feel like I have some tendencies toward it? It's hard to explain. I'll try.

My ex used to beat me in the car a lot. The other day my current boyfriend reached over to tickle me (playfully) and I literally lost it. I was screaming so hard. He felt really confused. I explained it to him and he was understanding.

Now I can't watch movies with even a little suspense. I used to be this girl who could watch the scariest movies, but now I can't handle anything. I know...kind of a first world problem, but still.

I have recurring nightmares that scare me. They feel real. I sometimes have flashbacks (not often, but sometimes).

I could keep going. I kind of just feel like I need to talk to somebody. I don't even know what I'm specifically asking for. There was a support group in town for those who survived domestic violence, but I don't know why I haven't gone. I am 23/f if that matters.

2i2627,"Just found this Subreddit, maybe you can give me some guidance. So here's the backstory first; grew up around people that have never handled their anger well - things being thrown, people getting up in eachothers' faces, things of that sort - so I learned to adapt and become a stonewall in some respects. I.E. if I'm getting chewed out for something or other, I just give up listening and put on a poker face.

That's worked for a while, and I've rarely let any anger get to me, until recently. Within the past 4 months, just moved across the country and I know no one. Any of my usual conversational outs are gone, my need to let it out has been growing. I live in a shit house, in a shit city, and around realllly shitty people. I still live with my family, I lost my job in a mix of my own anger and their crappy policy. 

(Short Story Time!: Supervisor had been grilling me repeatedly on an extremely busy day, lunchtime came around and I punched out just ready to go talk to my friend and get out some of the pent up anger, when the supervisor stepped in front of me telling me I couldn't go. Company Policy dictates no one can tell you you can't take your lunch or bring you back from it early. I said 'no, you pissed me off already, I'm already out for lunch' and I walked out the doors. When I got back I was fired for 
insubordination. You can be terminated at any time for any reason.)

Since then, I've applied to nearly every location in the city that has a position similar to what I did previously, and just this last month I've started to do locations where I have no experience at all. I've been locked in this house, with no car, no bike, nothing, a few miles farther out of the city than what it'd take me to walk comfortably. (Bad-ish back, and certainly not in good shape.) Rural area is starting to screw with my head.

Day in, and day out, I've seen sitting in this house cleaning, watching TV, and browsing the web. I'm at a loss, I have no money to do with what I will, I need to get the hell out, and I've got no outs. I'm on the verge of my sanity.

That said, I went over the edge a bit not long ago. Roughly an hour earlier tonight. I was playing a game trying to let off some steam, some kid started complaining about something, I muted him moved on and the game I was playing I started doing really bad in. And something just clicked.

In anger I (this is going to sound really fucking stupid and I have no clue why I did it) punched myself in the face. Not once but twice, hard enough to leave a bruise and jog a nice headache. After that, a short while later I switched from anger to sadness and tears just started welling over.

I am truly at my wit's end here, and I don't know which way to turn.

2ug96q,"[HELP] Paranoia... Ugh, I've been handling my anxiety quite well for the past year, up until now where I'm required to work in remote locations for up to 3 weeks at a time. I've had heaps of time in my own head up here and I just can't get over these intrusive thoughts...

I've always been afraid that one day i'll become psychotic. I understand that if i were truly psychotic that i probably wouldn't realize. As much as I can grasp that, my scum bag brain progresses to make me feel like: ""Well, you don't have it, but you could potentially get it one day"". This follows the same logic as ""I could potentially have cancer, or aids one day.. I don't have it now, but there's a small chance in the future I could have it"".. I'm able to shrug those thoughts off, but when it comes to being psychotic, nah.. it MUST be true...

Where am I at now? Well the past day i've been having paranoid like obsessions. Such as, i'll walk past a few guys and hear them talking, straight away my brain tells me ""they're talking shit about you"". I know this is irrational, and i'm able to logically explain why that thought is bullshit, and that it is because of my OCD.. but the doubt just rushes in and takes over. It's more so the fact that my brain just goes ""If you were psychotic, you'd have these types of thoughts"", then my brain goes on to make these thoughts up. 

I think this is due to all my lack of sleep lately, I sleep a lot (usually 8-10 hours) but lately i've been getting progressively more tired every day due to only having around 6 hours sleep, so i believe it's possible that i'm just mentally knackered (working 10.5 hour days, 13 day fortnights). Tonight i'm going to bed nice and early to see if this helps.

It's not just that... I just have this constant feeling of dread. I just feel constantly worried, don't know why, I just do.. I can't explain it, but i'm sure most of you understand.

30gxs3,"false memories/ associations? I'm not sure where to start, but in high school my senior year, I dated this guy who I had a crush on all through school. I was head over heels in love and I was convinced he was too! He broke up with me after graduation, I found out he had been using me just to have a girlfriend, had never intended to stay together like he had assured me all year, and had lied to me all year. After, I felt so used and hurt and all I felt was anger, because I blamed myself for not realizing. Our relationship was far from perfect, and in hindsight I can see the emotional abuse that he put me through. We never had sex, but we did everything but. He was very conservative Christian, from a very male dominated church, and the day after we would do anything physical he would place the blame on me and say that we should never do that again, but the next time I would go over to his house he would initiate things and would pressure me until I would. I changed my entire personality for him, I became very submissive and lost friends. After he broke up with me, he literally blocked me off of every social media site and we haven't spoken since that day. I never really got any closure, just mutual friends letting me in on what his real agenda had been. Looking back, I wonder if that was an abusive relationship. After we broke up, I met my current boyfriend, now of three years, and when we first started dating I was so hesitant to start anything physical, and would feel terrible when we did. I told him everything that happened when I finally could admit it a few months later, and it helped me move on and I no longer feel bad about sexual intimacy,  but I still think about that relationship often, not because I miss it but because I'm not sure why I feel almost traumatized by it. I've thought about going to a therapist, but I really just need someone to tell me I'm justified in feeling violated and emotionally taken advantage of years later. I was never raped or at the time feeling like I was abused, but after learning about signs of abuse, that relationship is like a textbook example to me.

102xro,"Need advice on new relationship. About seven months ago, I broke up with a guy (lets call him Bob) that I had been seeing for three years. I had been seeing him since I was 16 and he was a year younger than I. At about the one and a half year mark, he broke up with me and left me heart broken. During this time I met a really great guy (lets call him Bill), but as soon as I started seeing Bill, Bob came running back. And for some reason, my brain decided that this was a good move (this is important later on). He had type one diabetes or juvenile diabetes (insulin dependent) and would frequently allow his glucose levels to get out of control. He would get angry with me frequently, during these times I would try to leave and let him cool off because, quite frankly I was terrified. The problem was that he didnt like me trying to leave and would stop me physically. At one point in time I found myself clinging to a door frame trying to break free of his grip while he repeatedly jerked on my rib cage trying to pull me back inside of his parent's house. I finally got the courage to leave him and with the help and support of my friends and his parents I stayed away from Bob for a full month. My friends never knew fully what was going on because I keep my problems to myself. After a month, I started to talk to Bill again. He is the sweetest guy you will ever meet and was raised in that old-fashion hold-the-door-open-for-women protect-her-no-matter-what way so needless to say, I found this refreshing. The issue is that I have certain quirks (anger is a big one) that will cause me to shut down and want to run away because of Bob. Bill is understanding and wants to help me, but I feel that it might be putting a strain on our current relationship.

1xrpp2,"Anger towards nobody in particular I don't know exactly who or what I'm angry at. I can feel my blood boiling and I can't sit still right now.

I'm angry at my ex. I'm angry at her new cool boyfriend. I'm angry at myself. I'm angry at my father. I'm filled with rage and I have no idea what to do. 

Ten fucking days I have spent more or less calm and collected. Getting over her. Getting used to the idea of him. Accepting that I have problems. But monday I was hit with a thought. A crazy fucking thought, but there it was. 

*What if I were just to kill myself,* I thought. It'd be easy. Hang my dog's choker from the hook on the ceiling and fit my head in and hop off a chair. Done. I silenced these thoughts. I know they are irrational. I know I can get through this. But it's a question of *do I want to deal with it all.* No, I fucking don't. I have social anxiety along with OCD and all that fucking shit that comes with that. The constant worry that I smell bad. The shower rituals, the blood phobia, the misophonia. Shit, I even have trouble with empathy. My mother? I'm sorry, but I find it very hard to appreciate all the shit she does for me. I know she does it, but I just don't care. And I can't bring myself to.

And now here I am. Sitting. Jealous and angry that my ex is so happy. No, I can't just be happy for her. She didn't even do anything wrong. The breakup was a mutual agreement but of course, I feel this anger anyway. Because I'm a narcissistic prick just like my father. Just like my father, I know I'm intelligent. And he knows too because while my siblings were treated like shit, I was the fucking favourite. They're too good for me. Because they don't hold any of it against me. I never stood up for them. I'm the spitting image of the very man they despise and they show me unconditional love and acceptance and I just can't understand.

1fl036,"I hurt my son while calming him down for bed. Hi, this is my first time posting here.  I have suffered from anger issues for years, and only recently (late 2011) started counseling and medication for anxiety and depression.  With that aside, here's my problem.

The other night, my two-year-old son would not calm down at bedtime. He's usually pretty hard to get to sleep, so that wasn't out of the ordinary, really. But that night was extra bad, so I was lying down with him on my bed. I had his legs locked in mine and had my arms wrapped around him to keep him from kicking, scratching, and biting me.

I wasn't holding him that hard so that I wouldn't squeeze him too much, so he managed to wriggle an arm free and started scratching and pinching me. It had been a long day, and I was tired, so I yelled at him to stop. He didn't, and continued his behavior. I yelled again for him to stop pinching, and that he was hurting his daddy. Again with the pinching.

So I said that was enough, and I pinched him back. He didn't like it, but it also didn't make him change his attitude. He was, of course, fussy and tired, and being pinched didn't help.

I've never laid a hand on my kids, and I know better. Both my mom and my wife were abused as kids. I just don't know what was going through my head when I pinched my son. I guess I wanted to make him feel what it felt like to be pinched in an effort to get him to stop pinching me, and stop pinching in general (as this has been a problem he has had for a while now).

As of yesterday, my son still had red marks where I pinched him. My wife said if I ever do anything like that to our kids again, she's leaving and taking the kids with her. And I wouldn't blame her. I would do the same thing if our roles were reversed.

Our marriage was already rocky before this, so I feel like this has been the death knell, that we're through.

In the last few months, I have gotten fairly close with a girl named Lucy. Lucy was abused as a child so it was something that brought us together. I shared a lot of details about my abuse with her that I haven't shared even with my closest friends (I always worry that talking to them about it will make them uncomfortable), and she shared a lot with me as well. Eventually Lucy began to develop romantic feelings towards me, and ended up asking me to date her. I rejected her as gently as I could as I have feelings for someone else. She seemed to understand, all was good. 

Fast forward to about a week ago. Turns out, Lucy wasn't as understanding as I thought. She ended up telling people very detailed accounts of my abuse. Ever since then, I've had a lot of people I only know casually approaching me to ask questions. Having people I barely know wanting to know about something that personal makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I don't really know how to handle this. I don't want to come off as an asshole by telling these people to fuck off, because some of them are people I need to keep a friendly relationship with for business reasons.

1xky8s,"4 8 I was told I've been emotionally abused but I can't wrap my head around it. More insight?(Update) Well he told me he wanted to talk the other day and said he wanted to work in things and hang out more and what not. It really confused me. I read that a users will cycle their behavior. I also read that a users will make the abused feel like they are at fault for their behavior. I think this are both true. It's still hard though to figure out. A couple days after that chat he went back to isolating himself and ignoring me. 

I'm still very confused. I need courage mostly, that and some extra cash but that's my problem. Does anyone have any more suggestions? Am I doing the right thing? I'm going back to my home town in a couple days to talk to my dad about it more. I also have to figure out what to do with our roommate, my cousin. He is probably moving with me as he has no home here so that's a struggle. 

Regardless I plan to move in two months minimum. Hopefully I will have a job lined up and a place to stay and my lease agreement figured out by then.

Also last question. Will lawyers talk to me for free if I want to look into laws on breaking a lease due to being abused? I'm not concerned about getting my deposit back i just don't want to pay the fine for breaking the lease. 

Ok one last also. I have furniture I need to get rid of. If you live in Montana or know someone who does who wants to buy it let me know. My SO is always on craigslist so it is iffy to advertise there but once I do leave him I will. Until then if a redditor comes forward and wants my furniture I will give them a deal on it. 

Thank you!

Edit: Don't know why the numbers are there in the title :P also I looked up the laws. I can leave without penalty with evidence of physical abuse which he raped me once a month or so ago. That was it. Otherwise I lose my deposit plus a fee of 625 plus I have to pay upkeep till the place is rented out. So I have to stay till the lease is up and we can't kick him out because then we wouldn't be able to afford the cost of living. So I have to just stay for 7 more months and hope for the best.

1c40zr,"Was I abused? This is so fucking embarrassing for me to ask and say, I've never mentioned it to someone before but I think I was abused as a child.
When I was 6 a new family moved into my neighbour hood, they had a 12 year old daughter and shortly after they moved in we became friends.


I don't know where to start, one day when we was sitting in her room she started to touch me up my top. I was just a kid, I didn't know what was happening. I didn't want to make her angry so I didn't say no or stop, does that mean I agreed to it?

I'm so ashamed of the other things she made me do, she used to make up a 'game' that we was parents having sex, she told me that all the other kids played this game, I had no other friends at the time so I believed her. She would make me play this 'game' whenever I was in her room. Because she was young herself does that mean it was okay? 


I told her to stop once and she punched me in the stomach. Her family moved away after about 3 months of living in my neighbourhood.

21bxte,"Triggered a year ago, then triggered again recently. Help. (Possible TW) 20 years ago I suffered sexual abuse. I processed, crushed the memories, and finished growing up, more or less unaffected. 

Last year, a dickwad of an ex-friend accused me of supporting and abetting rape and rape culture. I was so incensed that I lost a day to flashbacks and horror. Since then, I've had periodic flashbacks of the same two memories that were left behind after all others were crushed and locked away. 

I have a new sexual partner. He's fun, and to my utter shock, male. I felt almost normal in my approach to him, and it's been exhilarating! It's a long distance relationship, and we're only 5 weeks into knowing eachother at all, but we've been playing with suggestible mind-states. It never occurred to me that he would be able to trigger a flashback, so I never bothered to mention it. I was enjoying normalhood. 

At the time, I was so relaxed, that he was able to divert me without causing an obvious meltdown, but afterwards I was so stressed that I decided it was only fair he understood why I responded so strongly. 

Ever since that evening, when I explained what happened, I've been getting back more and more memories, and feeling more vulnerable. I keep crying, and yesterday I almost walked straight back out of work as soon as I arrived. I think I had a very quiet panic attack from about 8:45 am until 4pm. 

My Husband is highly supportive (we're polyamorous, just roll with it) and caring, but this has caused a relapse in my heart condition. I don't want to tell work, this isn't me, my life, or a feature in my personality, so I don't want to have to keep explaining my sexual history to people. 

**what is better for me**? Do I keep getting my informed friends to listen to me, and ask me questions, thereby bringing up all the buried horrors, or do I let it run in silence, letting the memories come up and fade of their own accord?",abuse,"['triggered', 'year', 'ago', 'triggered', 'recently', 'help', 'possible', 'tw', 'years', 'ago', 'suffered', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'processed', 'crushed', 'memories', 'finished', 'growing', 'less', 'unaffected', 'last', 'year', 'dickwad', 'ex', 'friend', 'accused', 'supporting', 'abetting', 'rape', 'rape', 'culture', 'incensed', 'lost', 'day', 'flashbacks', 'horror', 'since', 'periodic', 'flashbacks', 'two', 'memories', 'left', 'behind', 'others', 'crushed', 'locked', 'away', 'new', 'sexual', 'partner', 'fun', 'utter', 'shock', 'male', 'felt', 'almost', 'normal', 'approach', 'exhilarating', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship', 'weeks', 'knowing', 'eachother', 'playing', 'suggestible', 'mind', 'states', 'never', 'occurred', 'would', 'able', 'trigger', 'flashback', 'never', 'bothered', 'mention', 'enjoying', 'normalhood', 'time', 'relaxed', 'able', 'divert', 'without', 'causing', 'obvious', 'meltdown', 'afterwards', 'stressed', 'decided', 'fair', 'understood', 'responded', 'strongly', 'ever', 'since', 'evening', 'explained', 'happened', 'getting', 'back', 'memories', 'feeling', 'vulnerable', 'keep', 'crying', 'yesterday', 'almost', 'walked', 'straight', 'back', 'work', 'soon', 'arrived', 'think', 'quiet', 'panic', 'attack', 'pm', 'husband', 'highly', 'supportive', 'polyamorous', 'roll', 'caring', 'caused', 'relapse', 'heart', 'condition', 'want', 'tell', 'work', 'life', 'feature', 'personality', 'want', 'keep', 'explaining', 'sexual', 'history', 'people', 'better', 'keep', 'getting', 'informed', 'friends', 'listen', 'ask', 'questions', 'thereby', 'bringing', 'buried', 'horrors', 'let', 'run', 'silence', 'letting', 'memories', 'come', 'fade', 'accord']"
qdnaz,"Update from previous post.. Escaped. So I have posted before about my situation, but deleted it.. Abusive relationship with physical violence, Was being coerced into staying with the destruction of my belongings and other threats. Extreme guilt-tripping and other verbal/emotional killers too. I managed to pinpoint a time period where she would be out for a good chunk of the day, packed my things and bolted. All my stuff is at my work office, thanks to an understanding boss. I don't think she has come home yet to find things gone, but I am practically having an anxiety attack just thinking about it. I worry for myself to be strong and not answer or listen to her calls/voicemails/emails/etc, and for her not to do anything to herself (I hope the threats have been bluffs). Terrified would be more accurate maybe.

I have a realtor looking for a new place for me, and can crash at friends and work in the meantime.

What should my next step be? I'm looking forward to some rest and sleep (Major sleep deprivation this week), and some personal time to play some videogames and read a book or two. Small pleasures I haven't enjoyed for a long time.

Just wanted to post for others to see in similar situations. I'm very scared, but I have some moral support from some friends and it feels like I'm doing the right thing. Can't wait for this to blow over.

2e6gwv,"My[30 F] brother[40 M] tried to molest and drown me when I was a toddler. I haven't seen him in years and he has been constantly trying to contact me over the years to forgive him. What are your thoughts on this message he sent me? He constantly messages me on Facebook asking to meet me and I have blocked his main account. I did not realize that I had not blocked the other account he contacts me on - and he thinks this is a signal that I want to be contacted.

Today he sent me another message saying that he is going on holiday with his son and girlfriend and if I don't reply by the time he gets back he will not contact me again. He said ""I don't know what your scared of. Are you scared of seeing me and falling for me or something I really don't know"". He even added: ""we don't have to tell anyone you have got in contact with me"".

Is that an uneducated way of saying ""you will like me as a brother"" or some kind fear he thinks I actually have of falling in love with my half brother. It makes me feel disgusting to be associated with that thought.

What the hell am I supposed to do in this situation? His mother died when he was 5 and our father was a violent alcoholic. When my mother left him I was 3 and my half-brother stayed with my father before being sent to a children's home. He later told my mother that he went to therapy and he thinks our father molested him. When I was 3 he asked me to suck on him (he was 12/13), which I didn't. He also tried to drown me in the bath.

What do you think the best course of action is here?

1fgays,"I'm never sure if I overreacted or not.. A couple months ago I decided I would talk to/see/deal with my family as little as possible as a reaction to stuff that happened between us one weekend.

My mom called me and said she wanted to give me her car, which turned out to be her way of trying to get me to think she was going to kill herself, not a real offer. (not the first time)then she had a total psychotic breakdown, her boyfriend/sister called me to tell me. and as the closest related family member i had to drive home (i live in another state)and call 911 on her.

i went to my dad's house to talk about what happened. he wasn't very interested in talking about it, then told me i was ""just a thief"" because i was wearing what i thought was an old sweater no one wore much that i had taken last time i had been there. (note: i don't steal from them ever, not something i have done in the past)

I saw it as examples of longstanding patterns of behavior from them that finally crossed a line. Not like ""I'm pissed, I'm not talking to them anymore,"" more like ""I don't feel safe here/dealing with my parents always makes me feel horrible""

i usually want to be forgiving. but my moms alcohol and mental instability make me scared of her, my dad and stepmom are so generally negative, mean, condescending, that they make me depressed and panicky. i don't know if i'm being reasonable or not.

I'm not really looking for advice or anything... Maybe just someone to echo my experience.

I feel like the roof just collapsed on me. I can't breathe. My chest hurts so much. I can't cry, it feels stuck. 

I just have this insane feeling something terrible is about to happen. I feel like there's impending doom and I can't do anything about it so I'm just freaking out right now and there's nothing I can do. I'm really worried about my ex and I don't really know why.

It's making me realize I have no one to turn to, no one I can trust. My best friend is probably busy with her boyfriend and maybe the other friend is busy with hers too. There's not a single person I can call right now to calm me down or distract me. No one really gives a shit, and no one really knows either. The only people who have known aren't in my life anymore.

I just want the physical pain to stop. I want to breathe properly again, that's all. My stomach hurts so much too. And the more I feel like this the more nervous I get it won't stop, which doesn't help.

This one sat on the sofa as he belonged there, I remember making no effort to talk to him. He soon left and I assumed I would never see him again, like all the others. Months later, btw I had never heard of this man again nor did my mother mention at all of his re-visit, he showed up at our door with all his luggage and my mother escorted him to her room. Only then was I told he was going to live with us. This man had moved all the way from Ireland to live with us ... and I was told on the day.  
I was soon a visitor in my own home, on the first night he was there he sent me to my room and at no point did my mother try to impose that she, and only she, was my parent. Now dont get me wrong, but I was a very quiet and shy child so there really wasnt a *reason* to send me to my room. 

I soon was taught the meaning of "" Children should be seen and not heard"" and if before I saw my mother scarcely, then now I had no idea who my mother was. He was a raving alcoholic and was bringing my mother down with him, she was constantly drunk or hungover.  That's when it started. I woke up one evening to her screaming, utter terror, I ran out of my room and he was on top of her punching her in the chest. I screamed and he ran after me, he pulled my hair and I fell to the ground, he stomped on my feet and legs calling me a ""little cow"". That was the beginning of my new terror of a life. He would come into my room at 3 in the morning and wake me up by punching me  and no matter how much screamed, my mother would never wake up from her alcohol induced coma. I tried to tell her, I was scared to death, she didn't believe me - told me my bruises were from PE. 

She never believed me, even though this man was beating her too, she would let him have the control over my life as if she never was my parent. I ran away from home countless times, begged her not to make me live with him, she told me I was making it up. I hated her, she made my childhood a living hell. He eventually left when I was 13, not because my mother finally saw what a horrible excuse for a human being he was, but because he left her for another woman. I hated her for that too. Even after all that, it wasn't her throwing him out. 

I cannot express the hatred I have for that man even enough... I just know is that if I saw him again, I'd probably contemplate murder. What he did to me, to my mother, and to our relationship will never be fixed. 
I love my mother to bits, she has shown me how very bright she is, and she has gotten control over her alcohol abuse. She has never fully admits the mistakes she made. which makes me so angry... I can never fully understand how a mother can see her daughter suffer like that and just watch. Im afraid Ill hold this grudge this the end of my days. How can I fix us?

2spl9e,"How do you start over, after 5 yrs of DV, and alcoholism? How do prevent yourself from going back? After 5 years of DV, verbal, physical, emotional abuse, I finally made him leave tonight. Told him it's over. So many injuries over the years, court cases, missed work, lost friends, made up stories to hide the embarrassment at home. Last night I had to lock myself in the bathroom to escape and just cried, hoping he would not destroy the house, or hurt my animals. I took the house key and made him leave, he came back to get some stuff and hurt me some more and left. I want to believe it's finally over, but how do I move forward? I'm shaking, and in a state of shock. I want this to be it, to be done. How do I keep from believing his lies when he begs to come home tomorrow? He will give me some story of not being able to afford to stay in a hotel, and he needs more time. I need to find strength from somewhere. I want to believe some day I can have a real, loving relationship, I hope this is possible. I wouldn't even know what that's like. 
Any advice to move forward would be appreciated.

oodrr,"My adventure through the darkness Hi everyone, I just wanted to tell my story. Hopefully those that are hurting can read and relate and learn. Enjoy :)

When I was 8, I was repeatedly abused (physically, psychologically, verbally, and sexually) by a summer teacher. He was the type of abuser that professed his love and affection yet thought it was okay to rip my clothes off as I pleaded for an end to the pain. So, my trust in adults was pretty much shattered; so was my trust in teachers and my own parents. For 8 years I ignored the trauma, going as far as developing memory-retention issues because I was trying so hard to forget. Finally I snapped in 10^th grade. Although I finally admitted to myself that I was abused, I always looked at myself as a victim.  
Now, six years later, I finally have gone to therapy (offered by my college and by the local rape crisis center, RCIS). I continue to go to the RCIS and have started to look deeper in the memories, having so much detail that I started to have vivid flashbacks and emotional instability.

I learned something though, through this adventure: I have to deal with it. I can't continue ignoring that I was hurt and it affected my entire life. But I can't let this fact burden me. It is a part of my life, yes, but that's it: only *one* part of it. There are so many other great things that have happened that show to me and the world that I survived; I made it and will continue living and I will become the best man I can be.

The trip was tough. It still is. There is no end to the path. There is no goal, no winners or losers; just the adventure. By thinking about my abuse like this, I can fall. I can make mistakes and stumble and fall back into the darkness. But I can lift myself back up, even if it means I have to crawl for a while. And by bringing someone special into my life, I can ask for help. I can lean on him, hold his hand, race with him, and laugh and cry with him. Together, we can help each other in the crazy adventure we call life. 

It's important to remember some important things (in a nice little bullet system for easy reading):
* good coping styles develop after some time with poor styles.
* talking about it to someone you trust can be liberating. 
* talking about it with someone with a similar trauma can be even more helpful.
* reinterpreting the event positively (like thinking of yourself as a survivor not a victim) can help decrease symptoms.
* how you reacted and cope with the abuse is **normal**. You may feel that you are alone and that no one can understand, but there are many who feel that way. So remember you're not alone, and we're all here to help :)

22cqs7,"Taking care of my mental health is such a struggle, and I don't feel motivated to take personal responsibility. I'm not sure if it is because of the multiple incidents of abuse I have faced but I feel like taking care of my mental health is such a struggle that I've almost given up. It's hard to access good help. 
I also feel that I struggle to take personal responsibility for my mental health. I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me, that other people do to me which is outside of my control and if other people are just nice enough love can fix my problems. I feel that I have come to be quite unproactive about my mental health. Does anyone else feel the same ?

This is so different however from how I relate to my physical health which I am very proactive about. I feel that my body is mine and I am in a way alone with it if it is diseased, no one can save me from myself so I need to take care of myself. I'm the one that is going to suffer if I don't take care of my physical body not other people, not the doctors. I feel that it is my responsibility to take care of my physical body. 

But with my mental health I find it hard to see it this way. Maybe I have just been attacked too many times so I've given up hope that I can keep myself safe and healthy mentally. I feel like mental health is something that just happens to me and isn't within my reach to take care of. For me medical care for my physical health has been a lot easier to access than mental healthcare. I might have gotten frustrated and given up over my physical health if medicine and medical care were practically impossible to access the way that mental healthcare has been.",abuse,"['taking', 'care', 'mental', 'health', 'struggle', 'feel', 'motivated', 'take', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'sure', 'multiple', 'incidents', 'abuse', 'faced', 'feel', 'like', 'taking', 'care', 'mental', 'health', 'struggle', 'almost', 'given', 'hard', 'access', 'good', 'help', 'also', 'feel', 'struggle', 'take', 'personal', 'responsibility', 'mental', 'health', 'feel', 'like', 'mental', 'health', 'something', 'happens', 'people', 'outside', 'control', 'people', 'nice', 'enough', 'love', 'fix', 'problems', 'feel', 'come', 'quite', 'unproactive', 'mental', 'health', 'anyone', 'else', 'feel', 'different', 'however', 'relate', 'physical', 'health', 'proactive', 'feel', 'body', 'mine', 'way', 'alone', 'diseased', 'one', 'save', 'need', 'take', 'care', 'one', 'going', 'suffer', 'take', 'care', 'physical', 'body', 'people', 'doctors', 'feel', 'responsibility', 'take', 'care', 'physical', 'body', 'mental', 'health', 'find', 'hard', 'see', 'way', 'maybe', 'attacked', 'many', 'times', 'given', 'hope', 'keep', 'safe', 'healthy', 'mentally', 'feel', 'like', 'mental', 'health', 'something', 'happens', 'within', 'reach', 'take', 'care', 'medical', 'care', 'physical', 'health', 'lot', 'easier', 'access', 'mental', 'healthcare', 'might', 'gotten', 'frustrated', 'given', 'physical', 'health', 'medicine', 'medical', 'care', 'practically', 'impossible', 'access', 'way', 'mental', 'healthcare']"

mqi9q,"I would like to share my story to help others. I will get to the point where he was abusive with me. At the time we were together about 3 1/2 years, living together for three. We had two children and I was pregnant with our third. We found out that he was getting laid off at the end of the month (August 2010.) He was offered a job in florida, about two hours away from family. So we moved there, and things got bad. Before we moved it wasn't bad, just emotional abuse mostly, very rarely he was physical with me. Fast forward I was around 7 months pregnant at the time, and within a week, be slapped me, threw me into the wall, kneed me in the stomach (well uterus at the time) and to top it off he pushed me and I fell and broke my arm. After that happened he swore he didn't touch me again, and he didnt until about 6 months later. This time was worse than any other.  Over the course of two months, he slapped me, pushed me  kicked me almost daily. The emotional abuse was daily. He busted my lip, gave me a black eye, and tried to rape me twice. I know what youre thinking, I stayed because I didn't think I could raise three children on my own. He made me believe that I couldn't. Anyways, one day was extremely bad, it was 7/25/2011 I will never forget this day. 

It was a good day, the NFL lockout had ended, we were grilling out to celebrate. I asked him to come inside and basically spend some time

My boyfriend and I were a little too tipsy, and honestly I cant remember what we were fighting about. All I remember is having my face slammed into the floor, waking up to a black eye, bruised lip and chin, and bruises along the left side of my face. 

He's apologised several times, I haven't said anything back. He's like, ""I can't believe I did this to you"" He says he's never hit a woman before.

2l7ogx,"Pissed. 1. I'm a senior in high school. I have worked at a grade school for a year making minimum wage. I worked with kids until April of last year, then i got put on janitor duty. It was fine, i really enjoyed working with the guy i was partnered with. We'd talk about sports and movies, he was 23 but treated me like i was his age. We worked over the summer with 2 more guys. One being 23, the other my age. When the guy i originally started with in April left in August, the 3 of us were put on year round duty, and  i was made the head janitor. Well the one that's my age is a prick. He is literally the most infuriating person to work with. He never shows up to work and when he does he is an hour late and half asses his way through it. Not only do i get in trouble for his screw ups, now that there is 3 of us my pays gone down. 13 hours in 2 weeks. Unbelievable, i know. How does he still have a job? His sister is dating my bosses brother. My boss has even said he isn't working out. Then scheduled him 5 days a week. Outrageous.

2. My sister is a year younger than me and a model student. She doesn't have many friends so  she isn't out as much as me. She pulls straights A's. Me on the other hand, I'm pretty popular with everyone (not trying to be concieted, didn't know how else to word it.) I'm always counting down the days till the weekend, i love to have fun. I pull B's, a few A's good enough for 3.0 and to get into the college of my choice. My parents constantly praise my sister on her work, yet I have straight A's and they still yell at me about school. It's so damn infuriating. 

3. Girls. Like every other 18 year old guy, i love girls. So theres this one girl who I've been head over heels for since the summer of my sophomore year. We have the same group of friends and have been on and off the past year or so. Anyways i said enough of that and burned the bridges. JUST as I'm getting over her she calls me and says i need to talk to her. I pick her up and we drive and she tells me they found a tumor in her liver and shes scared and needs me. I start talking to her again, but i made it clear: FRIENDS ONLY. Shes fine and the liver tumor may have been a story made up, I'm not sure. All i know is she's telling people she wants to start up again with me, which is not cool because she knows I'll do it and end up sad again. I'm like a Dallas Cowboys fan, I always go back optimistic on a superbowl, but i know deep down they'll finish 8-8.

I just needed to vent. I dont know how to talk to people about problems and these are only 3 of mine right now. I find myself yelling uncontrollably at times. I'm acting bipolar, I'm positive I'm not, but my sisters think i have a problem.

The chill of winter was upon us, as the warmth of the alcohol set in our stomachs. We all knew each other pretty well, and the average tone of an easy evening of drinks at a friends house, dressed the evening graciously. Or so I had thought.    A new couple, we were. The trust had been new, and our lack of knowledge, on certain personality traits caused a certain destruction, as he mistook a harmless moment, for something more threatening. A moment of socialization, and a quick fall back of comfort, to test on the softness of the bed which we sat. A simple mistake, to lay with a friend of the same gender, as a man was also present. A moment of apathy for the man who claimed my heart, gazed upon us, unknowingly. The threat was clear in his eyes, and so the fire began.   A blur of events, mostly drunken fights, and attempts to calm down the monster which was released upon us. Or so we thought. This was nothing compared to what was in store in the near certain future. Who could of foretold it anyway? As he grasped my arm and dragged me home, a silent plea for help, to the closest friend n proximity, although speaking with ones eyes isn't the best way to go about it. Please help me. The words i tried to send subconsciously, for I knew what would happen the moment we got home. Or so I thought.   The true monster was unleashed the moment we set foot through the door. A push or a hit, filled with endless rage and apathy, from a sad and broken little boy. Hours of his grief and madness, as he felt the need to punish me for something so minute. So small. A knee in my back as I lay on the bed. The true strength of alcohol, as he ripped off his shirt, and wrapped it around my neck. Was he trying to pull my head off my shoulders?

A distant voice in the darkness, told me its not my time, and told me to go back.   That was the night I died.   A part of me regrets the return, opening my eyes to find a sad little,boy, crying uncontrollably, begging for my awakening. A part of me wonders why he was so quick to change back into that monster, the moment I awoke again. Hitting me in the face, angry, so angry. But for what? What did I do so wrong? I must of done something horrible to deserve such a brutal attack. I could not recall what had even happened, only that I was in a different part of the room than before I had slept. Why is he hurting me? I had become trained to avoid such situations. I had learned my lesson. I had blamed myself, and the eagerness to fulfill the unreasonable expectations that were intertwined.

2x7vs9,"I think *this* wasn't abusive. Am I denying again? So I have experienced violent sexual abuse starting when I was 9/10  and lasting until I was 11, but for a long time, I had conflicting &amp; confusing feelings toward the (adult) abuser. Not any more.

I'm asking about something else that happened when I was 11.

~~The other day I was hanging out with a group of friends, and one of them talked about her first romantic kiss. It was a sweet and innocent story, and I shared the story of my first kiss. *Of course* I don't share anything about my abuse, and honestly my first kiss is a completely different thing. So I thought.~~

~~Later that evening a good friend of mine (who almost knows about my abuse, but doesn't know any details) was, I don't know, really caring about me, asked several times how I was doing, and offered me a drive home.~~

~~It wasn't until the next day that I realized what he was thinking - that I had been sharing a piece of my abuse.~~ Talking to him made it clear to me that my first kiss may have been less sweet and innocent than I always thought: A babysitter, 3.5 years older than me (I was 12), who kissed me goodnight and slept in my bed. We did this a few times in a row, and it felt, well sweet and innocent. In fact, she was one of the people who (I think) really helped me during that time. We run into each other every other year, and I think I still really like her. I don't want to put her in the same box as my abuser. My abuse is a completely different story, isn't it? 

But my friend insisted this isn't what a responsible babysitter should do, and I guess he's right. Also, her and I have never really talked about those kisses (she didn't ask me if I wanted a kiss).

Sorry for ranting &amp; thank you for staying with me. &lt;3

I am a 23yo female. He is a 25 yo male. We've been together for 4 years, married for 6 months. I'd been unhappy for a white, then about a week ago we got into an argument in car. He yelled at me, thumped me in the forehead (I can't think of any better description) and kept calling me stupid. I guess that bump in the head just brought that clarity that I need to get out. I know this but I still can't seem to bring myself to leave.  I don't know if its because I'm still so in love with him, my fear of loneliness, or embarrassment of telling my family (who looooove him) that we couldn't make it work. 

I never considered myself to be in an abusive relationship until I sat down to write my husband a letter letting him know how upset I am and that I plan to leave. Maybe its not even abusive, maybe he just has anger issues. Either way, he has hurt me multiple times. He has pushed me around, he has grabbed and bruised me, he has busted my lip, he has raped me (only once though), he has isolated me from friends, he has said very hurtful things to me. Every time I've tried to leave before he has told me I'm not THAT attractive and I'm crazy to think I'll find someone as good as him.

After one beating, I told him the next time he touches me I'm leaving. He promised it would never happen again and made an appointment with a counselor.that was all a little over a year ago. Of course, it has happened multiple times since and he skipped his appointment.  

He knows I'm thinking about leaving and has been on his best behavior. He even swears to go to counseling this time. 

I'm going to visit my Aunt tonight.  I haven't told anyone about all of this, so the loneliness seems to make it worse.

2wajyb,"I got angry for the first time in 2 years... Thankfully I didn't hurt someone. Need some advice. If there are any typing mistakes, my apologies, I'm still shaking from the adrenalin rush. Got upset with someone I work with and I""m not sure how to proceed.

Thankfully I didn't go my normal route and attempt to kill him. He felt threatened, started an argument over something simple, then escalated it to near physical confrontation and threats. Outwardly I remained calm(except for the shaking), but it took a while to calm down. More details on that in the comments.

My question isn't necessarily about anger, but about the proper response. If this happened previously, I would sit down with my employee, classmate, or client and have a friendly discussion about the event, and how we can better communicate in the future. We'd talk about psychology and cooperation. In this case I am a temporary employee of a hostel, as is the other person. For lack of a better word, he attempted to bully me. The last bully I dealt with was in elementary school, and to deal with him, I struck fear into the hearts and minds of all of my classmates(the bully included) and the faculty through an act of extreme violence.

3325ic,"Finally out of an abusive relationship I apologize if this is long... it all just happened on Thursday night (I also posted this in No Contact, but found it to be more appropriate here)

My ex and I overall have been together for 3 years, but the last 7-8 months...he's been on and off with me and another girl. Eventually the other girl and I contacted each other finding out what a loser he was, but we still both wanted him (I know, this is so embarrassing to type). So every few weeks after a fight with one of us, he would bounce back with her or with me.

Anyways, we tried again for 50th time about 2 weeks ago and it was going fine and casual, until the other girl reached out to me asking if I'd been talking to him. I said yes, and hanging out everyday. She was like wtf him and I hung out on Sunday and Monday. I confronted him and he admitted to seeing her.

I told him on Thursday I didn't want anything to do with him anymore and to go away. He shows up at my school with flowers (knowing where I park and what time I get out). He begs me to just go to dinner and I obliged and said JUST a quick dinner. He offered to drive and I was like okay. So he parks in my neighborhood after he follows me home to park my car and for me to grab a jacket. In the car, he is crying and BEGGING me to give him another chance and I'm just super cold and said no. As soon as I said it, he FLOORS it out of my neighborhood at a ridiculous speed, and I'm like ""oh shit"". I've never seen his face/demeanor turn like that.

So basically, every time I said ""no, I do not want to be with you/please take me home"", he presses down his gas pedal on the freeway to about 100+ mph to scare me. We then stopped at the mall to go eat, and I said ""no Im calling my friend to take me home"". He follows me around the parking lot shouting at my from the window to get in the car. I say NO...then he says ""okay okay I'll just take you home"". Then I get in (like an idiot believing him), and he's like ""PSYCHE, you're stuck with me forever"". At this point, I text my mom that I love her because I didnt know what he was capable of. He goes on and on about wanting me and needing me forever and threatens to take me to Los Angeles since he has a full tank of gas. Then once again...everytime I say NO, I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU, he says ""i'll just leave you somewhere and you can find your way home.""

In the end, I agreed to be with him only to get home safe...and I did after 3 hours of pure torture of him driving erratically and crying that he will never let me go. He still insisted on face timing when he got home that night, which I did because I didn't want him coming back to my house. He's extremely controlling and possessive of me saying he needs me and will commit suicide if i leave him (even though HE HAS a side chick and constantly blames ME for his issues). My therapist said that he basically kidnapped me, and if this ever happens again, I should call 911.

I blocked him, and threatened him with a restraining order yesterday and he finally hasn't contacted me. Day 1.

Thank you for letting me vent out this story and reading this. Brownie points for you if you got to the end :)

2sl4s4,"slightly weird one--mean parent turned nice/having trouble handling it Hey everyone! I have an odd one that is one of those ""nonproblems""/""its all in your head""/""GTFOI"" probably.

My father used to be, well, mean. Like, abusively mean. Not just ""you are grounded until I say so"" sort of stuff; like, narcissistically emotionally abusive and (when I was younger) physically borderline-abusive as well. It's kind of done a number on my self-esteem and identity.

I've worked on myself over the past few years, and I don't know what changed, but my father has been nicer these past few years as well. Part of it is that we don't see each other a lot, but he makes genuine efforts to be nice.

This should be good, right? In the abstract/overall it is, but I find myself holding my breath, bracing myself, waiting for the other shoe to drop. More problematic, it *hurts* when he is nice to me. I don't know why, but something about it stings and makes me feel like crying or throwing up when he is kind to me.

So most of that probably needs to be worked on internally...but I don't know what to do in my approach to him? We are not a ""talky"" family; I do not feel comfortable bringing up my feelings with my father, nor do I think I ever will. But I feel....""fake"" when I am trying to be nice back, like I am humoring him, like I am unable to be genuine with him. I never expected to be able to be genuine with him, nor do I think I ever will be more than a little, but I uh....just don't know how to approach him, now. I don't *really* want to be open and honest with him; I know he wouldn't be able to handle me criticizing him (he is very sensitive.) So how do I....make him feel good? While still keeping the appropriate distance that I feel safe and whole and not subsumed under him and his wants and needs?

t7t1w,"Am I in an abusive relationship? My boyfriend and I (f) (both 21) have been dating for ten months, living together for three. Throughout our relationship we have broken up dozens of times, but always got back together (often without working out our problems).

In that time, he has made it seem (whether it's true or not) that the problems we have are all caused by me, without fail. Our fights have become extremely explosive, with both of us screaming at each other, to the point where we physically confront one another (more on that later).

I feel he insults and demeans me more than is justified, even when I've told him how it makes me feel. The most common insult is to my intelligence, although one he used to use a lot during our fights is about the attractiveness of my vagina, that it is ""loose"", and how I am a slut. This is especially damaging to me, as my vagina is the thing I am most self-concious about, a result of an incident of minor sexual abuse when I was 7 (he knows about this).

He makes me feel like an absolute terrible person.

Before I go into the physical confrontation part, I feel I need to say that I am not innocent in that, and also that when things are good I am extremely happy and that we love each other very much.

When we fight, for some reason (immaturity, pettiness, etc), we both let it escalate to extremes. Our last major fight resulted in him stealing my ipod and refusing to give it back (stupid, yes, but this is similar to when he lived on his own and I had lent him my tv - we broke up and he refused to give it back, saying he'd call the cops if I didn't leave and claim it was his). In the end I tried to wrestle it from him (futile) and it resulted in my using my nails to cut into his arm, both of us hitting each other (lightly), and him wrapping his arm around my throat (again, not crushing my throat, just enough to freak me out and hurt a little). After that I grabbed his macbook and told him I'd return it when he returned my ipod (immature, I know). He was furious. He approached me, cornered me in our kitchen, and dug his fingers into my ribs as hard as he could, causing me to go on my tip toes and back up as much as I could to get away from it. This resulted in scrapes on my back from the pantry which are still sore despite this happening almost a week ago.

We have since made up. That is not the first time our fights have become physical. He has slapped me and kneed me in the stomach (mildly). He denies hitting me, saying that if he had actually hit me, I'd be in the hospital.

Currently we're in another fight (another break up, just like every one of our fights). I'm not sure how to deal with it.

I also don't know if what I've gotten myself into is abusive, seeing as how I hit him back, too. What do I do?

2ik11i,"It's been three years, but I think I'm still going through an echo of the abusive cycle? I need advice... Is this a thing?  

My first serious relationship was with an abuser.  By the end of it, we went through the cycle of abuse like clockwork.  I literally started planning my life around the knowledge that every 2-3 weeks I would be spending the weekend locked up in the house with him, going through the explosion then apology part of it.  Then I'd be able to work and function normally for about a week before the tension buildup had me walking on eggshells again.

I'm finally in a long-term relationship again, and I'm realizing...  I think I'm still going through the cycle on my own.  Every week or two I start getting tense and depressed, followed by an implosion where I sort of stop functioning for no reason.  I try to reassure my boyfriend that it's not because of him, that it's something self-generated, but it still hurts him...  He still thinks that if he was better somehow or did something different, I wouldn't go through it anymore.

The only thing I'm sure of is that it's not because of my current partner.  But, I'm still trying to figure out what it really is and how to stop...

1ws1l3,"Feeling finally free after a 24 year burden has been lifted. This is amazing! So a little bit of back story. I grew up in a very verbally, physically, and sexually abusive household from the age of about 3 to 8 years old. After that I went to live with my Grandparents. My brother's father who was married to my mother at the time made my life a living hell. I won't go into too much detail but I suffered pretty much every type of abuse imaginable during those 5 years.

This abuse has made it really difficult for me to connect completely with my husband. We have been together since we were 15 years old. Married for over 4 years and together for over 11. So our relationship is really strong despite all of the hangups I have had over this past abuse. The sexual abuse is what has really hindered us. He hasn't been upset over the lack of intimacy because we are intimate in other ways. I just can't bring myself to have intercourse very often. We weren't intimate like that until a year into our marriage and since our marriage 4 years ago it has only happened like 3 other times.

Well we were recently iced in due to the crazy snow storm that just hit the South. That left us with 3 days of really learning how to reconnect with each other. We have done more talking and opening up about past issues than we ever have. I feel so alive. I finally feel free. I feel like a human being with feelings for the first time in my life, instead of an object. It is an amazing feeling. I have held this burden of abuse for going on 24 years now and it has been a rough road. Today I finally can say I am free and can finally begin to work on bringing myself closer to my husband in all aspects of a marriage! I just really wanted to share this because this is such an amazing thing that I never thought would happen. I never thought I would reach this point!


**TL;DR: I was abused emotionally, physically, and sexually for a period of 5 years from a very young age. Sexual abuse led to some issues with intimacy but never caused a problem in marriage.

1yhyks,"Starting to lose control Since going to a university I hate, in a poor excuse for a city I hate, full of people I hate I am starting to lose it. The first term i went through a pretty traumatic break up where I was cheated on and reminded of it by my she devil ex. I started to go to the gym though and now it's the second term. However Tuesday I experienced a death of my cat. May sound petty but we grew up together, same age from babies till now. No matter what went on in my life I was always able to find peace and happiness when just relaxing with him. He was loving. When he died I did not cry. I miss him more than I can describe and would give anything to have him back. However I didn't cry despite how traumatic it is. I feel completely desensitized, be it from watching dark things on the internet or past traumatic experiences. But today I have been experiencing fits of rage at the most slight things, I just get mad out of no where and throw things and punch. I'm loosing my head here. I don't want to bullshit myself meditating or taking silly breaths as it will annoy me more. I go to the gym. I don't know what to do, the uni counselors are useless and didn't get back to me last time. I felt very uncomfortable there. In fact I don't think im even posting looking for help. Just me venting now after a fit of rage. It's disgusting. All I can feel is anger now. No empathy or sadness. I hate it. I don't want to be a void. I don't know what is wrong with me but it makes me mad that I can only feel mad! If that makes sense. I'll try and stick it out here though.

My current boyfriend is awesome and doesn't exhibit any of the same controlling behaviour. However there was one incident. We had been drinking and had rough (completely consensual) sex. We were about to call it a night when he grabbed my hair and I had to ask him to stop multiple times before he finally let go. I was scared and therefore what he did was wrong and was disrespectful. He knows that and has apologized and taken responsibility for his actions. The thing is I feel like if my past didn't exist this would barely register as an incident. I realize that my past relationship made my fears worse. 

I am looking for ways to get past this fear which has resurfaced. It's not likely but the fear still exists that my current boyfriend will eventually become like my ex. I never saw it coming the first time and I'm afraid I'll just wake up one day and be right back in the abuse.

The guy that blames everyone else when he fucks up, never owning up to his mistakes.

He wants to control everything, your beliefs, opinions and favorite things.

He's really good at telling you what you want to hear, so he can get what he wants.

The type of person that constantly tries to one up everyone over the stupidest shit. Even corrects people if he can't find a tangent to one up someone with.

Half the time he tells you something, it's a lie or half truth, just to get the satisfaction of being better than someone.

The guy that blows up in rage over nothing and has passive aggressive little vendettas against anyone who has done him wrong.

When he's called out on being wrong, he does anything he can to wipe himself of blame even by crying and playing the victim card.

This kid constantly explodes in anger against his girlfriend and his mother, two of the sweetest people ever.

He's not afraid to use physical violence to assert himself when angered, not much but still too much. Pushing his sister, punching a TV over FIFA, etc.

Luckily he doesn't drink because of these outbursts.

He was like this as a child but he fixed it. Then 3 years ago his control started to slip and it appears worse then ever. Since 3 years ago, I don't think he's made someone smile legitimately (without half-faced lies), not even his jokes are funny anymore. It's not even anger anymore, he just transforms into a monster and is constantly bitter and doesn't give a single fuck about anyone.

I had hoped that as time progressed and I got some distance from the relationship, the scars would fade - but I still feel completely torn up some days.

2ipvbh,"Physically abused child becomes protective of siblings I have been googling terms related to this and have been unable to find anything about it. I would like to know what others' experiences are in relation to becoming the protector of your siblings (younger and/or older).
   Personally for me, I have recently been processing trauma narratives with my therapist on a weekly basis. This has really helped me and has also shed some light on some of my strong personality traits that I have never really taken notice of. One of these traits is that I am extremely protective and tender towards all children. We have been discussing at length my need to have my dad beat me up instead of my other two sisters. There were many times that I took the abuse just to spare them. When I wasn't there to spare them I blamed myself. I have a younger and an older sister, and I am also female. 

I am interested to know what other people have experienced or noticed in regard to this. 

Some questions:
-What makes some children see themselves as stronger and/or the martyr?
-What affect does this have on the child once they have reached adulthood?
-Does the protective child deal with overwhelming feelings of guilt in everyday situations as an adult?

Would like to hear from anybody, whether you were the protector, the protected, a parent, a caretaker, a therapist, etc.... I just can't seem to find anything on it and would really like to delve into this more. I feel like I can turn it around and see this as a positive trait to be proud of. Right now I just feel like a failure. I know it would be beneficial to see myself as strong.

23psbk,"Have to cross paths with angry violent ex. TRO has expired. Do you have any tips for hiring personal security? I want to hire personal security for a weekend to ensure I'm safe from my violent ex. I have never done this before. Other than googling ""hire personal security in City Y"", I don't know how to go about choosing someone or what questions to ask (other than price). Do you have any tips or experiences you can share? 

_____
Backstory: 

Ex-bf beat me up a few years back. Serious medical care was required. I escaped the relationship, got the TRO, and have (mostly) felt (pretty) safe from him ever since (kindasorta). He still lurks alone in public places in my neighborhood even though he lives and works 30+ minutes away, but since he stopped making direct contact and threats, technically that's totally fine. I do still hear from acquaintances that the ex is ""constantly raging"" about me taking him to court and apparently he calls me ""the craziest of all the crazy bitches who ever tried to ruin his life."" Given that I'm not the only girl who's had to take him to family violence court + the lurking + that level of anger...it's just unsettling.

Now:

We work in the same field and we'll both have to attend a relatively small niche event soon.

The level of anger I feel on a daily basis will definitely give me some kind of health problems if it continues, not to mention the relationships I've lost because, true to the way I grew up, I went into some kind of red-out and said things I couldn't take back later.

So, when I think about going to see my family for the holidays, behind everything else, there is one thing that happened when I was 17. My mom and her partner made me stay in the closet. Her female partner.

I'm not sure if this is something a normal person would be mad about nearly a decade later. It affected me more than I'd like to admit. It was kind of the cherry on top of finishing school. I was figuring it out, becoming who I was, and the first time I really fell in love I was treated like a criminal every time I went to see her, under constant supervision and not allowed to tell *anyone* because oh no, what if the basketball coach found out? 

My best friend at the time also showed my girlfriend a really inappropriate level of attention. They would have private sleepovers and the GF's parents would let her spend the night, but not me. My 'friend' spent new year's with my GF's family the year after I was not allowed to, because I was gay/bi/whatever and she was 'straight'.

32sjjm,"[help] going to have a conversation with my rapist coming Sunday: Help/tips/tricks are VERY welcome Hi guys,

Sunday I am going to have a skype-conversation with my (21F) rapist (24M) ( I know it sounds stupid! and sometimes I think I am, but) I want to hear his reasons and thoughts and record it ( he's fine with that), so I can hear it back at any time instead of having to read e-mails and everything to get a glimpse of why I am not the fault - do you get what I''m saying?

what are some 'ground rules'/ tips you got for me and what should I ask him? I'm really nervous and every time I think about it I get really nauseous and dizzy, but I think it's good for me to do.

I want to record this conversation so I can listen it back on times when I feel that I did something wrong and feel depressed, and I want this all to be over. I still have flashbacks and nightmares every night ( it happened roughly two and a half years ago), I don't want to think of him, so I hope when I see him and hear his story, I can let it go and get rest.

If you have ANY tips/ suggestions - TELL ME! 


Love,

Dawn

ps) also, if you know other ways to get closure/ acceptance etc: let me know! 

**EDIT: I have done EMDR already- I'm with a psychologist and a psychiatrist ( I'm taking Wellbutrin/Brupropion XR 150) They all told me not to do it, and the people I ask on here tell me the same. I'm wrecking my brain to figure out what to do. the EMDR did only so much - I f I stop the medication I won't sleep and have nightmares and flashbacks again - and I'm just done with this shit. I REALLY don't know an other way then to start with the person who did this shit. My step-mother told me to do a 'ritual' and burn stuff, but I'm still too busy with everything... So I know it is not my fault (most of the time), but how could he do that? HOW? I know I am naive, and I want people to have a 3rd/4th/5th chance, I want to believe in the good-side of people, even this person. Did I deserve it? I already was the shy-girl, the girl who stayed inside and was afraid of people, but now... I can't even go outside without my boyfriend ( whom I'm living with) most of the time. I'm really afraid of men. How do I know they won't attack me when I just walk down the street? My Ex-boyfriend fucking raped me while we were friends- while we were watching movies together once a week or so... I trusted him. Why would I ever trust anyone again?**

2xjcxl,"I just joined a 'luxury' gym for childcare GUYS.  Holy sweet Jesus, I wish I'd known about this after my son was born.  I struggled to keep it together for 15 months until I finally cashed in my 401K to pay for childcare; 1/2 days at a Montessouri school.  Not cheap, but still cheaper than full time child care.  Vastly better than being a danger to my son, and he thrived in a pro-social, engaging environment while I had the space to be my best parenting self.

Then I learned about Mother's Morning Out programs at local churches.  *So reasonably priced*.  (Like half the cost of the Montessouri half-day program.)  Flexible options that fit into just about any budget for 3-4 hours a day, depending on how many days you need.

The Mother's Morning Out program was a lifesaver.

And now I have just discovered that several gyms in my area offer up to 2-3 hours a day, *including weekends and holidays*, of childcare.  It's not a replacement for my son's current program - nor would it be an ideal replacement in terms of socialization, routine, or one-on-one attention - but it is an amazing complement, available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.  And they do a Parent's Night Out once or twice a month.  They also have tumbling, yoga, art, and dance programs, among other things.  They are year round.

My son isn't napping anymore, summer programs are already selling out for anything from $85 to $200 *a week*, and I was truly terrified of not having any options.

But for a family membership with a monthly child fee add-on, I have almost 100 hours of childcare available.  For $147 a month.  No contract, no cancellation fee, though there is a sign up fee which honestly isn't dissimilar from daycare registration fees that I have paid.  And I managed to get a deal on that.

People have asked me about the best options for a stay-at-home parent to get a real break and come back refreshed and ready to be their best parenting self - and, in terms of optimal environment for the child combined with affordability, Mother's Morning Out programs are still my first recommendation - but if you are seriously struggling, I think the gym option is one to seriously consider.  And it is the cheapest thing I have seen by a long shot.

Obviously, you want to vet the teachers and facility, as well as commit to bringing your child(ren) on a schedule so they can receive the benefit of routine and acclimating to the teachers/programs.  Your mileage may vary depending on the options where you live.

I can't tell you how this has helped me in terms of stress and anxiety, reducing tendencies toward abusive behaviors, and given my family the space to enjoy each other.  I no longer feel trapped, stuck, desperate.

There's a boy, who's about 10 years old but somewhat large for his age. A little girl, who is around 6 years old and quite small for her age, has parents who are friends with the boy's parents. The girl's parents bring her over to his house on occasion. When nobody is around, the boy starts to sit really close to the girl. It makes her uncomfortable. He puts his hand on her back and then slowly puts it down the back of her pants into her underwear. The girl tells him to stop but the boy keeps pushing to continue. Sometimes it happens in the basement and he'll block the stairs to keep her from going up. Sometimes it happens upstairs even when the parents are in the room because he just puts his hand behind her back where no one can see and touches her butt inside her underwear. She's too embarrassed to even tell him to stop when he does it when the parents are around. He pulls her back if she tries to get up. At least once, he bribed her with her favorite Pokemon game. He said he'd let her play it if she let him touch her.

My mom doesn't want to tell her sister so instead of making her sister uncomfortable she makes me a disaster zone. My husband can't take much more of my mother's crap. This was bad enough. 

Add in yesterday I finally called her and she denied the whole thing. She said she only called to let me know my aunt might call and she genuinely believes herself. I have a new phone number so my mother had called to get permission to hand it over. It's a rule I have with my phone number. Some parts of my family are quite sick and were abusive or worse. I'm lost now. My mother and I had been getting closer but now not so much. 

I'm just having a hard time processing and have too many emotions building up. I'm also battling trying to hide them from my husband because he really can't handle my mom's crap much more. I have already decided to step back and not talk to her as much because I can't handle her games. I just don't know anymore.

2u5uyn,"How do I move on from this? Any advice from those who have experienced it?? I met my boyfriend a few years ago and we became best friends and fell in love immediately. There is no doubt in my mind, I thought he was the one. I adored this guy.

During our last year together he started getting verbally abusive, and later physically violent. I figured I was good at getting along with anyone, and I could adapt to him. I was wrong. The first time I realized there was a problem, he threatened to burn the house down, headbutted me, slapped me across the face, and tried handcuffing me. I was in shock and couldn't believe what had just happened - so I told him we should forget it ever happened.

After this, we were together with friends one night and he punched me in the eye &amp; spit in my face. I had to stay home from work for a week. Now our friends, our families, my coworkers, practically everyone knows what had happened. I was a mess and basically wanted to move home and have my mom take care of me.

Somehow I made it past the first couple weeks. But now... I still talk to my ex off and on. We understand each other; I catch myself frequently empathizing with him. It has been really emotional and maybe we have bonded over this (Stockholm Syndrome?)...

Now it's been months and I need help. I tried seeing a therapist, but that just made me more confused. I can't sleep at night - I get anxious and have flashbacks and nightmares. I meditate beforehand and once I tried taking a xanax, but still no luck. I cry ALL THE TIME.

I feel so betrayed that my best friend did this to me. I don't know how I will be able to trust someone again. I feel so alone, so ashamed, so misunderstood. I pretend to be okay around other people. I actually have a very good support system, but I don't want to push them out of my life by rehashing the same drama.

There were some other experiences which i will not go into depth now in the issue of brevity.

http://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/2xb77a/facing_homelessness/

tldr: trapped with a violent man, shelters are full, I am disabled and have no cash and nowhere to go so I can leave

I sold all of my furniture and managed to get enough money together to pay the landlord one payment of $200. I have to send another on March 16th or I will be evicted. The homeless shelter here is full as well as all the other shelters, so I have no place I can go to get away from this guy. Additionally I have a small dog. I've contacted a few places that do fostering but no one is getting back to me. I posted a AD on craigslist for help with a place to stay, since I will be on assistance soon and would be able to pay rent, but only creepy guys replied to me wanting photos. 

I feel absolutely trapped. There is no help to be found, and people wonder why women don't leave their abusers. I feel like the case worker I spoke to doesn't live in the same reality I do. She just said to pack one bag and leave, but if I do that I will end up in thousands of dollars in dept, homeless, have no place for my medications and medical equipment or electricity to use it, and my dog will probably be killed in a pound. How is that better than being hurt once in a while?

I don't have a job and cannot work because I am disabled, I don't have a car and can't drive because of my vision. The apartment and all the bills are in my name and if I just leave I will end up messing up my finances for the rest of my life. The domestic violence hotline seems useless. They just link me to shelters that have no room for new people. :(

Right now the only thing that will help me leave is money.

1nuuwj,"Frustrated. Hesitant to post but I just really need to get this out.

I'm a 17 year old black male in high school. I'm finding myself to be angry almost always. I hate the way the world works, the way people can be, I hate that there are things that can't change, and I hate that I feel powerless to change anything in my life, as well as the feeling. I hate myself, my lack of talent or ability to do anything on my own. People'll tell me I'm smart, but either modesty or a lack of self-esteem will make me audibly disagree. 

My life until now wasn't horrible all things considered. My dad beat me for misbehaving or not applying myself in school (never failed any class, however) but always has and even now means the best for me and I see that, despite the fact I usually never have a voice they can profoundly hear. 

My SO is going through the same thing but so much worse, and her parents don't seem to care about her at all, meanwhile every friend she's ever made but me ended up doing wrong by her at some point, so she has no real emotional refuge but me. I feel like getting to know her and what she deals with (among other outside influences at the time) was a huge wakeup call to me as to how cruel the world can be, and I just can't deal. People say to just ""go with the flow"", and even she's picked up that kind of philosophy, and I just fucking can't. Why should anyone just bear something negative if they don't deserve it? 

There's times when I realize that I have it easy or there's things I take for granted, and for a while I calm, but I can't stop hating myself for being useless and insignificant, and I can't stop hating the world that humanity made for his peers, but reliably wrongs others. And at my age I really need to decide what I want to do and how I'm going to try to do it. I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't have a fucking clue; I have so many questions.

I am a long-time redditor and life-long supporter of women's rights. I am part of a new non-profit organization, and we are campaigning this March to raise $21,000 for a domestic violence shelter in Armenia.

Women's rights and domestic violence are taboo issues in this country, and the statistics are frightening. We want to not only use this campaign to support this domestic violence shelter, but also to raise awareness, get rid of the taboo, and empower women.

We try to use social media to raise awareness and crowdfund this project, but I am posting on /r/women to ask you for your advice. **How can I reach out to more women around the world to gain support for this campaign?**

22vywb,"Why am I so angry? Basically is as the title says.  I have no rational reason to get angry, but it seems lately every little thing that happens makes me so angry.  I know it's stupid, and I really wish I didn't get so worked up about everything, but it seems that all the small things build up and are close to breaking me.  

It's got to the point that my physical health is actually being harmed due to anger (High blood pressure, sore heads and tingling in fingers), although I am in basically perfect condition from working out and dieting well

Some of the things I'd get angry over would be paranoia for example, I have a SO, who I know loves me, but I get paranoid that any time she's out with her friends, that she's cheating on me, even though I know it's not the case, then I have paranoia over if she's using me. Obviously I don't voice these concerns to her as I REALLY do not want to be that type of boyfriend, I've never even asked her anything related to that.  

As well, small things like if someone is driving too slow, someone in work is bothering me, or someone talking down to me, make me overwhelmingly angry, and I know it's over NOTHING.  I have no excuse to get worked up, but I really can't help it.

I just don't want to be physically and mentally plagued by anger, as it makes me constantly feel like shit for literally no reason.  How do I start to repair myself?

elrzx,"Recently left abusive-codependent girlfriend Crosspost from /r/relationships

I'm 24 years old and I'm recently out of a relationship that was abusive as a result of my partner's codependency. I've done a lot of reading about women being abusive as I started dealing with it and it led me to reading about codependency which fits her to a T.

Apparantly, being a conflict-avoidant male makes me the most likely type of person to get stuck in a relationship like this as I just did. It took three black eyes, a bloody nose and an uncountable number of marks, scratches for me to find my way out; and thats just the physical side of things. The emotional and verbal abuse was what really caused the pain.

Why was I so unable to admit to myself what was happening? Why did I keep making excuses for her? When I met her I was probably at the highest point in my life - I felt on top of the world. I was in the best shape of my life, got a great job right out of college, made a bunch of new friends in a brand new city and was excited to live through each and every day.

Fast forward 18 months of being with her and I let the relationship get in the way of the friendships I was building. It has affected work in the form of me working from home just to avoid having to explain my injuries to co-workers. I spent all my time, money and effort trying to fill her unsatiable desire to feel loved. My self esteem is absolutely shot from all the verbal abuse I've endured.

I have no explanation for it. Why the hell did I subject myself to this and how do I keep from making the same mistake again? 18 months ago I would have laughed at the idea of letting someone do that to me. I'm scared to death I'm going to let it happen again.

I'm almost ashamed to post here, I know what I'm going through isn't anything like what my partner has gone through, but I realize I'm having trouble working through issues that come up as a result of my partner's childhood sexual abuse.

I'm trying my damndest, but I need more perspective. I need someone to talk to. I can't tell people we know about what she's gone through, and what me, and the both of us are going through. There are also simply some things that would be unfair to my partner to discuss with her.

I've known I should have looked for some sort of support earlier, but reading through some of the posts here and crying about them, and realizing the people here are reaching out like I should be is pushing me to do this. I'm admittedly scared.

I also witnessed my mother physically assault and verbally abuse my father regularly, and once he moved out, I became the one that she took her anger out on. My hope is that those that have survived alcoholism or domestic violence, and particularly those with children (or that are young themselves) will take solace in knowing that they aren't alone in their struggles, and that we all have our ways of dealing with and getting through the abuse.

Too young to make sense of her father's behaviour, the little girl dreams up a fantasy in which a monster is terrorizing her family, leaving screams, cries, and broken bottles in his wake. Her loyal dog by her side, the little girl tries desperately to escape the horrors of her home, running faster and faster, until a terrible tragedy strikes.

18ofnn,"Please help, I am stuck with an abusive parent  First let me give you a little history before going into the problem at hand. 

My ""sperm donor dad""(SDD) was terribly abusive to my mother, verbally, mentally and physically. When my mom was pregnant with my little sister (I was 4 at the time) he pushed mom down some stairs. She got us out of there before my next birthday. It has been over 8 years since we started our new life, since then my mom remarried to my daddy, yes he may be my step parent but he is 100% my daddy.

We did not see him much that first year after the divorce but slowly he crept in and out of our lives. We would visit half a day most Saturday's. My mom never wanted to separate us from him, she said he anger was at her not us and we deserved to know him.  About a year ago the girlfriend my sperm donor has found out she could not have children after that things changed. Within six months SDD had filed for full custody of my sister and I. 

He and his now wife made up lots of stuff to make my mom and dad look like bad parents. Mom does not keep a clean house (its not filthy but hey it can get messy with 3 kids and 3 cats) Mom neglects us and is the reason my sister has trouble in school. 

He managed to get standard visitation 2 weekends a month and every Wednesday. It was horrible from the start, he is abusive. He grabs my arm, slaps me in the back of the head, shakes me, has knocked me down twice among other things. If you think his wife would stop it you are wrong. She purposefully gets me in trouble by saying I hurt her feelings or I made her cry. While SDD yells at me and threatens me she stands behind him making faces at me. 

I have told mom and dad and we have filed a police report a couple times, called DCFS but nobody believes me when you get right down to it. DCFS told said ""My diction is too good for a child my age"" and the police did not have enough evidence to push for an arrest. One things that bothers me is both SDD and his wife are medical professionals with a background in mental health. They know how to say the right things to DCFS and other to make me and my mom look bad. The other thing that bother me is my sister has to watch all this happen. 

I am 14 and will have to suffer this for 4 more years and my sister for 8 more if nobody can help. Its only a matter of time before he hurts my sister like he does me and I am scared I may die in his care one day. Still when I tell people this nobody believes me or my mom and dad.

1b336t,"Two years later. I stumbled here from r/twoxchromosomes and wanted to, I guess try to give a little support:

When I was 16 I started dating one of my closest friends of our extremely tight friends group. The first six months were great, typical high school relationship getting ready to graduate (was in an accelerated program) Then we graduated and moved in together that summer. He became controlling, limiting who I could see, where I could go, but I justified it as him just being the jealous type.
 Fast forward to the next year, He's convinced me to quit school and cut off almost all contact with my family. He was insecure, and extremely bipolar ( not using this as a scapegoat whatsoever) having used to local psych ward as a revolving door.

2yfnzd,"My boyfriend finally met my real dad I'm sorry for venting. I'm not sure if this is welcome here, seeing as there are no helpful tips or links and it's just me talking about my abuse.


This weekend my boyfriend went to my house while my dad was there. At one point I noticed some sort of confusion in the kitchen and I saw that the dog had gone through the trash so I went there to help my dad clean up. I knew he was angry at the dog, and I knew that if I showed up to help, he would leash out on me. That is exactly what he did, so I finished quickly and went back to my boyfriend. I was visibly upset and he asked what was wrong, so I told him about my father. And I read to him the following email that he had sent me:



""I am tired of treating you like a spoiled, irresponsible, dirty and messy little girl. This is not why I got married, this is not why I became a father. I don't want a 26 year old leaving things on the floor, clothes on the bed. I get embarrassed of what the cleaning boy sees in this house. I don't want to waste my time anymore talking about your lack of responsibility. You are hopeless and I am tired of sharing my house with people who don't care for it. I am not investing in you anymore, I am wasting my time. I have fulfilled my duties as a father.""



I used to believe my father. It kind of destroyed my self-esteem as I grew up and I noticed thanks to my friends and my boyfriend that I'm not really the scum of the earth that he says I am. I found this subreddit recently and I think my father is abusive. He's never physically hurt me, but he's morally aggressive and gets worse when he drinks. He has told me that he resents waking up because he'll have to deal with me. He has told me that I'm not his daughter anymore and that he wishes I'd just leave the house. He constantly compares me to my sister and tells me that when he was my age he was so different and independent. He's not like this all the time, but enough to make me scared of talking to him.

I'm going to go through the links and messages that have been posted to see if they can help me. Thanks to everyone who contributes to this sub.

I 've nearly broken my phone and want to drop kick my new computer over the balcony. The anger is taking its toll and I'm ready to snap.

I grew up in an abusive home from the time I was really little to about 18 when I finally moved out. Dad was supposedly abusive, the stepfather was a craptastic bastard and mom never tried to stop him; in fact she joined in. So what the hell, I have too. Better to join them in destroying shit, including myself and my beloved posessions than be the victim anymore, right?!

But in destroying everything I hold close, including relationships, it only makes me rage more. It's a vicious cycle that I'm afraid to get out of. I even actually kind of like the rage. It's the only time I feel powerful, not weak, anymore.

I know it needs to stop but I am afraid to get out of it because Who am I without it? weak.

1rm5g8,"How am I supposed to move on from being bullied if everything people told me to try and invalidate it makes no sense? I hung out with pretty much the same people through all years of high school. Since it was high school I was the designated member of the group to always be shat on and be the butt of every mean joke. I tried and failed to make new friends and anytime new people joined this group they would join in on bullying me so they could bond with the cooler people in the group.

A particularly scarring moment is when a girl started dating one of these ""friends"" and then starting using the relationship as leverage to have me excluded from the group. Since they excluded me on the regular anyway her behaviour was endorsed, and once they broke up and she stopped hanging out with us it was business as usual. This stopped sometime after I graduated high school and people from high school got in touch with me and started treating me differently. I'm 21 now and still haven't gotten over it.

Since the complete switch in how people treated me they (sometimes the exact same people) started telling me about how I'm a cool guy, about how it's not my fault that I got bullied, they're just dicks anyway. But it doesn't make any sense. If the bullying wasn't my fault, how come every single person I interacted with was in on it? If ""they were just dicks"" then how come everyone else liked them and had good interactions with them until the end of high school when people suddenly started being nice to me? If there was nothing wrong with me then why couldn't I make other friends?

I was sexually abused by my stepfather's daughter from his first marriage for 7 years, from age 5 to age 12. She was several years older. She made me think it was normal behavior, even though it was traumatizing and painful. I pretty much shut down, and never learned to really deal with it.

The worst part is that when my mother found out when I was 18, she said it was my fault for not telling. My other sister told me to just get over it, that bringing it up after all these years (I'm 33 now) will just destroy the family. 

I'm just so angry that everyone is so dismissive of something so terrible, something that went on right under my parents' noses that they could not or would not protect me from.

2k2fms,"It's never too late... I'm writing this post because our neighbors next door have been in a downward spiral in their relationship. 

The yelling, the crying, the sound of things being thrown around- it hurts. It hurts me. My abuser was my prince charming, my everything and my all. He hung the moon and the stars for me. We were married young and like all young adults you think you know everything. You think you are prepared for EVERYTHING. 

One day he comes home from being stationed away for training. (We were an Air Force family.) We'd had our fights here and there, but nothing aggressive or physical. That all changed when I didn't have dinner ready one evening. I'd never seen that side of him. My immediate reaction was ""What did I do? What can I do to change? I', so sorry."" It only progressed and got worse from there. Yelling turned to physical abuse, then he played the emotional game with me. ""If you leave me then I'll kill myself. I'm sorry, I'll change. Promise."" I painfully remember the nights full of yelling and tears. The begging for him not to leave and that I would change. The empty hours of promises. 

After months of abuse, emotional heart ache and physical pain my family welcomed me back home. I look back on our 4 year relationship and see so many red flags. The field looks like a penalty has been drawn but the players keep playing. His dad was an abuser, he was always so critical of everything I did, I was his possession, everything that went wrong was my fault, why did I do these things to hurt him, why would I ever think that he would like that.... the list goes on and on. 

Ladies and gents- it is NEVER too late to leave. It is NEVER too late to ask for help. Do yourself a favor...

uex76,"Problem: I hold myself to different standards than everyone else. I've always held myself to unreasonable standards. 

It really began as I was growing up playing sports. I was lucky enough to have a father who taught me love for all kinds of games and practiced with me. I quickly excelled at baseball. I never sat on the bench. I could play any position; wherever the team needed me on any particular night. Many nights began with me at 3rd, moving to catcher, and then moving to shortstop. Anyways, I was pretty good and I loved it. I even enjoyed practice. Still, I was never satisfied. I could catch 150 ground balls at a practice and only think about the one I missed. I always wanted to stay after practice and take extra batting and fielding practice. 

My perfectionist attitude led to outbursts. I was thrown out of a couple of games for acting out (throwing my bat, arguing with umpires). My teammates always supported me. They always tried to calm me down. Even when I wouldn't listen and was an asshole to them, they had my back. I think maybe the only reason they stuck with me was my willingness to do the same for them. 

That's where the unreasonable standards for myself come in. No matter what a teammate did, I never called him out on the field. The only exception being a lack of effort. If someone was trying and made a mistake, he didn't need anyone else to tell him what he'd done. All he needed was reassurance and refocus. Somehow I could give that to my teammates but I couldn't let myself receive the very same thing.

It obviously carried over to other sports. I'm also a pretty talented basketball player. I can score 20 points w/ 11 assists and all I'll think about is that one or two shots I missed or that one stupid pass I made. 

It's funny. When I'm on the field or the court, I get angry for just long enough to fuel the flame of competition. I get over it and remind myself that you have to take a shot to miss it or you can't get a pass stolen if you're too afraid to throw a risky one. 

Somehow I can't get past the little things like this so easily in everyday life. I just felt the rage when the place I wanted to get coffee was closed.

moo54,"Screw you, Mom. :)  Hi guys. I needed to vent. So, I'm going to write this out like I'm talking to my mother. To give you a bit of background I can sum it up by saying my mother is a complete narcissist. She doesn't live near me but has had an incredible influence on my life despite being the irresponsible fuck she is. :) 

Hey Mom. Guess what? Fuck you. I told you I remembered some pretty horrible things about you. You denied it all. My ""false memories"" and ""anger problems"" are just so damn tricky sometimes, aren't they? You saw what happened to me. And you are a terrible, terrible mother for letting it happen and being the colossal hypocrite that you truly are. But according to you, you are so perfect that it couldn't possibly have happened that way. I'm glad I've educated myself against your psychological manipulation. You've gas lighted me. 

Throughout the entire letter I told you why exactly I was mad at you and what it meant (as in, me and my daughter not wanting you in our lives). All you could do was gas light, make up reasons why I'm not remembering things right. It's funny though, it's really funny. The last time I told you someone abused me you made a HUGE FUSS and with me being a minor you started the whole investigation that ripped my family apart. The family you couldn't be apart of because you are just that shitty. But this time, when I told you I remembered being abused, and you were right there, you had witnessed it, you gave me the total opposite response. You figured you'd react the same way, and you know... I guess essentially you did. It was always about you. How you would have done something if you had been there, or how you would have NEVER possibly let that happen to me so I must be remembering it wrong. Fooooooook yeeeeeeeeeeeeew.

I feel so much better after having written you and told you to get out of my life. You think you can scare me by saying that you'll be there waiting for my daughter to come talk to you. But my daughter will be infinitely more well informed than I ever was and I doubt she will want to talk to a piece of shit like you.

1tbbnr,"Need help post-relationship, PTSD, going to court, so lost, about to break. I mostly need a place to vent. I was in an abusive relationship with a much older man for two years and police imposed a restraining order on my behalf after I finally called the police to a dispute. I was threatened for over a year by him, and was too scared to call police, but in August, he finally took it too far and I was scared for my life. He was evicted, I moved in with a friend, and I have been up and down since.

I recently found out he is pleading not guilty to assault (to which there is a LOT of evidence), so I have to go to court and testify, as does he. I am TERRIFIED. I do NOT want to see him. I will NEVER regret it if I do not try him in court.. but if I have to see him, I think I will break. Police called and told me that he was pleading not guilty and asked if I still wanted to take him to court. Without thinking twice I said yes, of course. He deserves justice. I KNOW he would do this again. It is just going to be so stressful. And who knows how long this process could take? I might have to be thinking about it for the next year, which causes me so much anxiety.

I did really well Sept-November, but this past month I have been a fucking mess. Everything has given away around me. I have not been in regular employment since he assaulted me and money is so tight it's causing immense stress and pressure. I can't afford a decent psychologist. Most days I want to die. I am at a loss. I loathe going to see counsellors because it feels so foreign. I suppress everything so much most the time that it is really hard to talk about it out loud to a counsellor. Maybe I just haven't found the right one yet. Every time I start to talk about my issues I feel like a lost cause, and that I won't ever be better or normal-functioning. No one I know can relate, or say anything reassuring to me. I think most people just leave me alone now as they are afraid of seeing me have a meltdown. Which happens often.

I have been receiving counselling but recently stopped seeing my psychologist as he was not helpful (some things he said were downright awful) - and I started seeing a government-funded female violence counsellor but after one session she said she didn't know how she could help me but said she would try. I see her again in two weeks. 

I am just really angry. And sad. I have let men take advantage of me, my entire life. It's so depressing. I want it to change now. For months afterward I felt empowered but now I truly feel battered and beaten down. Ready to give up. I have reached out to many community support networks for help but I feel unworthy of support a lot of the time, and everything is so slow-going it takes weeks to hear back about free solicitors/lawyers, counselling, etc. 

This ended up being incredibly long. Sorry. If anyone is in, or has been in a similar position, please PM me.

2fab9k,"Feedback and Support--Stop Domestic Violence Campaign via The Light Network Hey all. I'm one of the directors of The Light Network, a collection of Christian podcasts. During the month of October we will be raising awareness about domestic violence and domestic abuse issues by releasing a host of content dealing with the subject. Our intention is to cover it thoroughly and from as many perspectives as we can. 

I know that not everyone approaches domestic violence and abuse from the Christian vantage point; however, I hope that we may be able to do something to promote awareness and assist those who are being abused to find help. 

The purpose of my post is two-fold: 

1. To promote awareness about the campaign itself. 

2. To get your feedback concerning what topics, themes, and subjects need to be covered during a months worth of content. What books, articles, websites, and tools have you found the most useful? Those of you who are Christians, what texts or scriptures have brought you comfort and strength when such was needed? 

If you'd like more information about the campaign itself, you can find that [here](http://thelightnetwork.tv/stopviolence/).

29101m,"Hoping to get some outside perspective My husband is sometimes not so nice to our child and I (I'm convinced he has some kind of mental illness, not to play armchair psychologist...but I wouldn't be surprised if he has bipolar or BPD). 

To ME, it's him being an asshole. It's hard for me to view it as abuse because I have a good friend who was in a severely emotionally, verbally and physically abusive relationships that was so bad that their ex is now in prison. IMO, what they've been through is abuse, what I go through is just a guy who is mean. 

Anyways, I want some outside perspective. You guys know how I see it, obviously my friends and family will take my side in this and say its wrong (well...I know it is. He knows and admits that it is. The question is whether or not it's abusive behavior). 

Probably 80% of the time he's fine. He gets easily upset though and goes from zero to 60 in a second. 

He'll tell us (our child and I) to shut the fuck up if we talk or laugh while he's trying to do something or watching tv. 

He's thrown and broken stuff before. 

He does this passive aggressive thing where he'll grab stuff of mine and our child's, put it in a pile in the middle of the house and say we have XX minutes to find a better place for it or he'll throw it out. 

He kind of bullies me into doing stuff for him...he'll ask me to rub him or make him food and if I don't, he throws a tantrum, says ""don't bother coming to bed then"". 

I'm a SAHM, and when I mention wanting or needing something, he'll say ""well, where are **you** going to get the money for that?"".

When I tell him that him swearing and yelling at us isn't okay, he says I can GTFO if it's such a big deal.




So, what do you guys think? Like I said...I can't see it as abuse because the abusive I have seen with people close to me is SO much worse than that.

My mother in law (about 65) was kicked out of her house by her husband, who threatened to hurt her if she came back.  

We brought her to make a complaint at the police station, but she didn't want to go through with it because he would get arrested.

But she then decided to move in with me.  We took some of her stuff (we consider anything else to be gone) and moved her out.  She looks better already, although its a really hard time for her.

He always tried to control her and scare her.  He said that if she ever tried to leave he would have the police drag her back.  he would threaten her, tell her she was nothing, useless, and other horrible things.

Now, after 3 days he has run out of food and tried texting us (BS stuff, ie 'u not supposed to take my wife away' ).  We're keeping a record of all the texts.

right now I don't know what the future will bring, though I am sure she is here to stay.  But I don't know what our next steps are, or what to be careful for.  He is not a smart man, but he is devious and evil, so I want to limit any damage he could try.

The house was signed in his name, ma's name, and my wife's name.  1 car was probably signed the same, but might not have his name on it.  My wife has his name on her student loans as a co-signer.  I'm not sure if they bought their dog together, but Ma was the one taking care of it, he never cared (for anyone but himself).  Their phone plan is in his name (but we are getting new phones today).  She left behind a lot of stuff, but nothing that can't be replaced/left behind.

17ebza,"Hello /r/anger, I could use some advice about my little brother.  My little brother has been struggling with anger issues that seem especially bad over the last six months or so. He gets explosively angry over pretty minor set backs and he's a little out of control when this happens. 

Last night was an especially bad case. He and I were debating some stupid political point and we both got a little worked up. I decided to end the argument and we both sort of huffed to our respective bedrooms. After a few moments he just started screaming from inside his bedroom and slamming things. My first reaction was to just get out of the house and I started walking down our street but after leaving for a bit I could hear him from well outside our house so I turned back.

I came back home and he had punched up his walls and was raging in the garage, screaming really loud and pushing things around. I went in and tried to calm him down. He would settle down for a bit and then start screaming and raging again. He never attacked me and I never felt like he was going to, but this went on for well over an hour. He would go back and forth from sreaming and punching things to sitting down and sobbing about it and asking what was wrong with him. It was a shitty cycle where he would do something in anger and then feel bad about doing that in anger so he would get even angrier at himself. 

I'm leaving the country in a few weeks for a year and some of things he yelled were things along the lines of ""what do you care? You'll be gone a a month anyway!"" So now I'm feeling like I'm abandoning my brother as well. 

He eventually calmed down around and after my parents came home and he was super apologetic and acting like himself again. He kept apologizing to me and I told him it was okay and we joked about it a bit, but I'm just a little worried about him. Especially because I'm not going to be here for him. 

He acknowledges that he has an issue and he marvels at how he out of control he got but he also has no interest in seeing somebody about it and is especially against the idea of going on medication. He's almost 22 years old.

2ntal1,"Wrote a letter to re-connect with my father... Hello, all. 

Over the course of a few months, I wrote a letter that re-connected me with my father after not communicating for a little over three years. This period of non-communication was a result of years of emotional, verbal, and at times physical abuse. My father also has an undiagnosed mental illness - he hears things, he sees things, he is intensely paranoid of everything and everyone around him, and has been unable to hold a job for almost 20 years (my mom was the breadwinner of the family). 

Anyways...I'd like to share this letter, or at least half of it (as it is about 6 1/2 pages long). I think that people could use it as a ""frame"" to write their own letters to their abusers if they so desire. Is this the right place to post about this?

26ym59,"My mother celebrates my sister's teen pregnancy but treats me like a good for nothing POS because I have a serious psychiatric disorder. God, where to begin? My mother is delusional, basically. 

My 19-year-old sister found out she was pregnant at the end of last year and miscarried a couple months later. This was her second pregnancy and miscarriage, but my mother doesn't know about that one. A month or so ago my younger sister finds out she's pregnant again. This was a rebound pregnancy, with the same guy, her boyfriend. She has no job although he does. Still, I can't lie, I'm really frustrated with her. A part of me feels like I can't judge because I've never had a miscarriage and I know how hard it was on her, but I feel like the fact that she put her emotions first and decided to go ahead and get pregnant despite having no job, knowing full well she will need benefits, still living at home, shows that she is not emotionally mature enough to be having babies. Oh, and the babies thing may be literal. She is enormous and I am genuinely worried she may be having twins. I study midwifery and yeah, this isn't just your typical subsequent pregnancy bulge. Anyways, my mother actually yelled ""YES!"" down the phone when my sister told her... enough said. My sister stole from me the other day and I was yelled at by mom for being furious because my sister is 'under a lot of stress'. I said ""so it's okay for her to steal?"" To which my mother replies, ""Your sister has had a miscarriage."" Like I didn't bloody realise. In my books, that still doesn't mean you can steal from me. My sister is absolutely loving the attention and playing into the can do no wrong dream my mother is in. It's disgusting. 

Meanwhile, I have Borderline Personality Disorder, depression and anxiety. My moods and anxiety are crippling at times. I regularly get told to 'stop moaning' if I mention that I don't feel good, or I'm ignored completely. I just told my mother that my anxiety is really bad and her response was, ""Oh, well don't worry."" And then she went off to watch TV with my sister. Her lack of support is a much deeper issue that almost got me sectioned a few months ago. I'm just sick and tired of being treated like I'm absolutely worthless because I have an illness, whilst my teenage sister can keep getting pregnant and is rewarded.

I don't remember much from before or after, but those sort of details stuck with me like it happened just this morning.

I don't want to ask my mom about it too much, she's touchier on the subject than I am, but from what I gather, he had to pay me 250 euros as reconciliation and was ordered to move to another town.

1be21f,"My abusive ex is turning my son into one too My story is beyond tl;dr so I'm just gonna summarize:

How abusive was my ex-husband? The VA gave me a disability pension for non-service connected PTSD and panic disorder at 80% disabled. I was awarded SSI, first try, due to PTSD/Panic Disorder. I mean, just...bam, awarded. (I don't receive money, I still work full time. I cook in a daycare and don't interact with men much). 

My ex managed to lie his way to custody of my son in 2003. And lied his way to custody of my daughter last year (emergency custody for school purposes, while he was babysitting her while I was at my stepmom's funeral). 

I had my kids on Friday, the first day of having them for Spring Break. It's an odd numbered year, so I get Spring Break. 

My 15 year old son is very emotionally troubled, he's currently on parole for bringing a knife to school, and is failing every class. He's high functioning autistic with severe ADHD (his dad took him off his meds), and acts much younger than he is. 

My son is 6'2""-6'3"" and a solid 180-200 lbs. He's a BIG kid. I'm 5'9"" and average build. He towers over me. 

I found out he'd stolen an older phone from me and when he swore he didn't, I told him to look for it...since he was the last one with it before it vanished. He refused and tried to Death Stare me and shoulder check me, I grabbed his sleeve and then it was on. He did a classic move his dad would pull, grab my arm and twist. Oh hell naw. I broke his balance, by falling into my twisted arm, and leg swept him. Then I found myself with him in a headlock ...I don't know what's it called, it has him on his knees with one arm sticking out of it. It was from a self defense thing. The balance thing plus leg sweep came from a reddit thread on judo. Just days ago. 

I calmed him down and we both cried. But, holy shit, I just had to use self defense on my own child. I tried to talk to his father and was called a cunt. 

My son told me that he was terrified of his dad, and flipped out when I grabbed his sleeve, because his dad would do that to him before he hit him.

Every single time I've tried to do anything via the police or courts or cps, they believe my ex. My kids stepmom, who hates him too, backs him up. My son backs him up out of fear. 

My ex is a coward who will run away from men, but will pick on women and kids. 

I need to save my kids, but am terrified of not being believed and then making everything worse.

My family is less than worthless, I have very few friends, what can I do?

Edit: I mangled that title. Ack.

I am a 39 yo survivor of severe sexual and physical abuse by my step-brother and step-father (at different times of my life).  Although I have been through much therapy in the past and am for the most part well-adjusted, I still have major problems being vulnerable around my partner and others.  

To become a better man I have entered therapy to help deal with these issues of vulnerability and the lovely ever-present shame that we all know about.  My therapist has suggested EMDR therapy.  In EMDR therapy you need to create a safe place, a paternal protector, and a maternal nurturer in your head.  

So I guess my question to other survivors is, how do you create this place and these figures if you've never experienced them?  For that matter, how do you go about feeling vulnerable and safe if you've never experienced that before?  My abuse started when I was 7.  My memories of life before the abuse are foggy at best, and really don't contain what I'm looking for.  So I'm feeling a little lost.  

I'd like to hear about any experiences with EMDR and the other issues I've written about.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and stay strong my fellow survivors.

I live in a town in Oregon, my family is all in Ohio. I know they would help me if they could, but they are all struggling to survive too, and I feel terrible for asking them. My abuser was absent from our relationship for most of the time. He worked a lot and when he wasn't working, he was trolling the internet. He would never help with the kids, and when I started asking him to help out, he said that I was a stay at home mom and that I should respect him and do everything at home with the house and the kids. That's when everything started to get really bad. He said that since I didn't technically ""work"" (HA!) that I should do everything, and that when he was home, that it was his right to ""relax"" (i.e. talk online to random people all night). He then started putting me down, making me feel like shit, telling me I was a terrible mom and that I didn't deserve him. I thought about leaving then, but his words were really getting to me, and I started to believe them. To say I was depressed is an understatement. I took my kids and went to a shelter finally after he threatened me with physical violence and told me that I could never leave, because no one else would ever love me.
So now I'm in a shelter, I'm about to be kicked out because I've been here a month and they tell me I could probably get an extension, but it would only be for about another 2 weeks. Anyone else been in this position? Suggestions for my next step? 
I want to leave the state and go back to Ohio, but I'm afraid that because of the kids, he'll have justification for always keeping tabs on me...and that I might get in trouble for leaving without his permission since they're his kids too.

1xn8ob,"Please Read: My Mother's Ex-Boyfriend is Reaching a Point of Extreme Harm (Throwaway obviously) ~

I'll try to keep this concise, but I am growing continually more worried for my mother well being and life. I'm angry with myself for not seeing this entire situation sooner and intervening, but I am a freshmen in college in a nearby city so it became increasingly difficult.


She was in a relationship with an ex-con who was sentenced for manslaughter for killing the murderer of his father at a young age (~18/19 I believe) and is still on parole. They dated almost a year, and he was living at our house throughout most of this time. Though I find all of this out after the fact, apparently verbal abuse was common, and there were 5 instances of physical abuse. Upon the last (which ended with numerous bruises and a beat-up face.. heartbreaking to see one's mom like that), she decided to kick him out and end things.


Upon reading all of the messages this man sends my mom, I'm terrified for her life. He often references the bible, and seems to think that if he can't have her, nobody should. He sends her 2-3 emails EVERY day, the latest being him showing the shadow of his phone as if he were holding a gun. This last picture is not that subjective, and seems fairly clear as to how he is trying to intimidate her.

She has stayed at a woman's shelter and with family the past two weeks (after roughly seven weeks of ending things), but is now returned to the house. Both she and neighbors have claimed he drives by every day, even in her absence. I have no idea what I can do or how to help, but I feel that something has to be done.

I want to be the very best lawyer I can for my client, which of course involves a lot in terms of what is traditionally thought of as legal representation. But I wanted to ask those of you who have had a a lawyer for a DV-related issue, divorce, protective/restraining order, or whatever else: what do you wish your lawyer did/didn't do?

I walk down the street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I fall in.
I am lost .... I am helpless.
It isn't my fault.
It takes forever to find a way out.



Chapter Two

I walk down the street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. 
I pretend that I don't see it.
I fall in again.
I can't believe I am in this same place.
But, it isn't my fault.
It still takes a long time to get out.



Chapter Three

I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.
I see it is there.
I still fall in ... it's a habit ... but, my eyes are open.
I know where I am.
It is my fault.
I get out immediately.

mqyp0,"My not very pleasant past. AMA Hello Reddit! This is actually my first post - I just found the site randomly through google and found it super interesting. So I would like to share my dilemma and hopefully get some feedback. I have NEVER told anyone this before, except my mom. So please no judgements :( Im a 17 year old male, and like most teens my age, I'm confused about my sexuality and I do stupid things... My parents divorced when I was three, and I was raised solely by my mom from then on. The year after the divorce, my mom started dating again. As things got serious between them, they decided to move in together - and of course, I moved in with them and he pretty much became my step-dad. One time, this was only a few months after moving in with us, I remember him showing me his ""thing"" and told me that ""milk"" was gonna come out of it if I keep ... well masturbating him or in his own words, ""push and pull"". I vaguely remember the details, but i think there was another guy with him laughing. I was a little kid so like i didn't know what the hell was going on. That's the first incident that I can remember where it all began. This, btw, happened every time my mom was out for work. So... yea. He would always shower with me, and like masturbate my thing, or come nap beside me and well you know... masturbate... He didn't do anything else with me beside playing with my thing and making me play with his. Not only was I molested, I was also physically abused. Again, I vaguely remember the details, but i remember him pulling my hair and slapping me. I don't really remember the reason why. But yeah, that was basically it. This lasted for 3 years. It stopped when my mom asked me where i got my bruise from, and i told her. And then she started asking some more questions and eventually got the details out of me somehow. I didn't think anything of what he did was wrong - I had no idea I was being molested and abused. I don't know if my mom pursued any legal actions, and i really don't want to talk to her about it anymore. Well now, as I said, Im 17. I'd say I'm conventionally attractive. I'm very athletic and very social. The problem is.. 1) I think I'm being a little rebellious. I drink, I smoke cigarettes, I smoke marijuana. I also am super active in bed, I have a couple of ""friends with benefits"". But my constant excuse would be, Im in high school and I'm young so whatever. 2) I think I find guys physically attractive. Like I'm always curious what they would look like naked. I watch gay porn. however, I don't think I wanna do anything physical or be in a relationship with another guy. The thought is pretty uncomfortable, to be honest. Sooo basically, Im confused about my sexuality and I have this attitude of ""I do what I want"" without thinking of the possible consequences.",abuse,"['pleasant', 'past', 'ama', 'hello', 'reddit', 'actually', 'first', 'post', 'found', 'site', 'randomly', 'google', 'found', 'super', 'interesting', 'would', 'like', 'share', 'dilemma', 'hopefully', 'get', 'feedback', 'never', 'told', 'anyone', 'except', 'mom', 'please', 'judgements', 'im', 'year', 'old', 'male', 'like', 'teens', 'age', 'confused', 'sexuality', 'stupid', 'things', 'parents', 'divorced', 'three', 'raised', 'solely', 'mom', 'year', 'divorce', 'mom', 'started', 'dating', 'things', 'got', 'serious', 'decided', 'move', 'together', 'course', 'moved', 'pretty', 'much', 'became', 'step', 'dad', 'one', 'time', 'months', 'moving', 'us', 'remember', 'showing', 'thing', 'told', 'milk', 'gon', 'na', 'come', 'keep', 'well', 'masturbating', 'words', 'push', 'pull', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'details', 'think', 'another', 'guy', 'laughing', 'little', 'kid', 'like', 'know', 'hell', 'going', 'first', 'incident', 'remember', 'began', 'btw', 'happened', 'every', 'time', 'mom', 'work', 'yea', 'would', 'always', 'shower', 'like', 'masturbate', 'thing', 'come', 'nap', 'beside', 'well', 'know', 'masturbate', 'anything', 'else', 'beside', 'playing', 'thing', 'making', 'play', 'molested', 'also', 'physically', 'abused', 'vaguely', 'remember', 'details', 'remember', 'pulling', 'hair', 'slapping', 'really', 'remember', 'reason', 'yeah', 'basically', 'lasted', 'years', 'stopped', 'mom', 'asked', 'got', 'bruise', 'told', 'started', 'asking', 'questions', 'eventually', 'got', 'details', 'somehow', 'think', 'anything', 'wrong', 'idea', 'molested', 'abused', 'know', 'mom', 'pursued', 'legal', 'actions', 'really', 'want', 'talk', 'anymore', 'well', 'said', 'im', 'would', 'say', 'conventionally', 'attractive', 'athletic', 'social', 'problem', 'think', 'little', 'rebellious', 'drink', 'smoke', 'cigarettes', 'smoke', 'marijuana', 'also', 'super', 'active', 'bed', 'couple', 'friends', 'benefits', 'constant', 'excuse', 'would', 'im', 'high', 'school', 'young', 'whatever', 'think', 'find', 'guys', 'physically', 'attractive', 'like', 'always', 'curious', 'would', 'look', 'like', 'naked', 'watch', 'gay', 'porn', 'however', 'think', 'wan', 'na', 'anything', 'physical', 'relationship', 'another', 'guy', 'thought', 'pretty', 'uncomfortable', 'honest', 'sooo', 'basically', 'im', 'confused', 'sexuality', 'attitude', 'want', 'without', 'thinking', 'possible', 'consequences']"

34a0p5,"I wanted to hit my son this morning I didn't...but I wanted to hurt him.  Instead I kept breathing; breathing around and through and past the ache in the center of my chest, this ache that is suddenly gravity, the center of everything.  It's inexorable and unyielding and I couldn't breathe it away.  I screamed at him, and had him go to the bedroom for his safety, the only relief from my rage in his absence.  Then I breathed some more.

How did I miss, for almost the entirety of my adult life, the fact that I have an anxiety disorder?  I can't ever forget how close to the edge I really am.

We finally got to school after the age-appropriate toddler ridiculousness that happens after a disruption in the routine.  I've been breathing in the car.  I put on music.  I tell my son I need quiet, please.  I think I'm okay, but I still feel the weight of it, the ache in my chest.  I am very open with his teachers about my emotional state, how we are doing as a family, so they can better help my son...and this morning is no different.  One of his teachers gives me a hug, and I start to cry.  And I think, ""My son needs this hug"".  

I love him, but I can't look at him as I leave.  Thank god for his teachers, who will love him and hug him and do what I couldn't this morning.  Without them, without being able to trust that they care for him, without a break, without a perspective, I am my father.  I can never forget how close to the edge I am.

I've been crying, and my body finally begins to feel like it belongs to me again; the deep ache in my chest dissipates with each tear.

He doesn't deserve any of this, my incredible son.  Everyday is a struggle between competing programming, and sometimes I breathe so much and so deeply I feel like bellows.

I do well at them typically, but when I'm playing video games, or playing poker/magic online (it never happens when playing in person when my opponent is next to me) I snap and seem to go insane when I find myself losing.

Once I feel myself getting angry it leads to a terrible cycle where I get mad at myself for not even being able to enjoy my favorite things, and I spiral out of control very quickly. I've gone through a lot of controllers and keyboards, and also gotten a lot of headaches from hitting myself during these outbursts.

I know that one option is to avoid these things, but they're among the only hobbies I have, and when I'm not furious I really love them, it feels like avoiding them is just ignoring my anger problem rather than helping it.

I've tried a few simple things like trying to slow down and breath when I feel the anger coming, or to stop and give myself a rational reminder out loud ""It's just a game, nobody wins 100% of the time, and it wouldn't be fun if I did"", things like that

1eu81e,"I'm writing a mobile application for domestic abuse survivors and thoughts/ideas/suggestions are welcome. Hi all, I'm writing an application for Android phones designed to help domestic abuse survivors both gather some evidence of their abuse and allow them to seek help from a friend. The application is designed to run discreetly so as not to alert an abuser if they have the phone.

The application is written so that it runs silently in the background of the phone once it's started and when the survivor feels threatened they can activate the application by moving the phone in a certain way or by holding the volume down key for a number of seconds. 

When the app is activated it will start to record audio from the phones microphone and send out a text message to an emergency contact (or contacts) with a customisable message along with the location of the survivor. All of this is done in the background once the app is started so that the survivor can discreetly activate it and then not worry about the abuser seeing something on the screen if they obtain the phone. Many of the settings are customisable so that the survivor can tailor it to their needs.

What I'm wondering is what else would be useful in an application like this? What could I make better? Is there anything I should change? I've looked at applications such as [TecSOS](http://www.vodafone.com/content/index/about/foundation/mobiles_for_good/tecsos.html) in the UK and [Circle of 6](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.circleof6&amp;hl=en) and taken ideas from those apps and from their reviews to try and improve mine. Obviously this app could be useful not just for domestic abuse survivors but anyone who may find themselves in a worrying situation but I'm tailoring it towards abuse survivors.

2ohweb,"How to move forward? Wall of text incoming. So, last night my mother's husband went off the deep end. They came home after drinking and the first thing I hear is yelling. I walked upstairs, wanting to make sure everything was ok. 

He immediately started getting aggressive towards me, saying that I was""challenging"" him. All I had done was ask what was wrong and if I could help. 

I saw there was nothing I could do, as he was intoxicated, and vacated the scene. I went back downstairs and kept listening to make sure nothing got too out of hand. I was prepared to come to my mothers aid and/or call the cops... And then things got nasty. 

The next thing I hear is my mom calling urgently, ""Call the cops. He has a weapon and is coming downstairs."" I called the cops, and stayed with them on the line while my mom tried to calm down her husband. 

She somehow kept him from using the weapon (a shotgun) and the cops showed up. Apparently he had put the gun down by the time the cops showed up and so they did not arrest him. They got him to leave the house to calm down.

The cops then left, and I went about trying to console my mother. Then he walked back into the house. He immediately started threatening me, I'm guessing because I called the cops. He threatened to come to my work and put me in the hospital if he ever saw me again. He then lunged at me as I picked up the phone to call the cops again. I knocked his arm away, and was about to retaliate when my mom stepped in the way and got him out of the house. 

The cops showed up again, I told them what had happened and they found him and took him to his brother's house. They returned later, and said that they had taken him into custody for DV. My mother and I went and stayed the night with my brother and now I'm trying to figure out what to do next. 

I no longer feel safe, and wrote this partially to vent and partially to ask for advice. I have a sister that lives across the state and I am considering going to stay with her for a while, but that would mean leaving my job and enrolling in a different college. I am willing to do these things, but I don't know if leaving is the right thing to do, or if I am just giving him more power. I am also worried about my mother, and how to help her deal with this, how to be supportive, but also get her to do what she needs to in order to ensure her safety. So, any advice, reddit?

2arvcv,"Trouble finding help, feel like I'm doomed to stay a victim. I'm currently in an abusive relationship. It has taken me many years to fully understand this fact, but I see it now. A big problem being that I'm a man. I'm 32 years old and I'm a fairly big guy, so to see myself as ""abused"" never quite set it until recently.  

My currently wife is an unstable person. She is very much verbally and emotionally abusive. I have endured this for many years, just dealing with it and making excuses for why it is. The past couple years verbal has turned to physical. She has punched me in the head on many occasions, pushed me, slapped me and on one occasion grabbed a snow brush from her trunk and wailed on me until I called 911. That one earned her a night in jail.

The real problem of this whole situation lies in one point. We have a child. My daughter is 5 years old and just about the sweetest little girl you could ever imagine. Unfortunately, she's trapped in the middle of all this, and witnesses pretty much everything. Even worse is that the rage is sometimes turned towards her. She is cussed as often and on rare occasions spanked or grabbed aggressively (if this happens in my view I immediately put a stop to it).

So... with this information, I've made a decision to get out and get my daughter out. The problem now becomes how. There isn't any help I can find out there for a male DV victim. I've been told from different places that they only help women, or they don't have any funding available or, once I was even told ""man up, she's smaller than you."" I didn't even know how to respond to that.

I've reached out to friends and family, but I've realized recently she has done a wonderful job of driving them all away. I have practically nobody left. I tried setting up a GoFundMe account for help. That got me a whole $25. I can't seem to get help anywhere and I think I'm just going to have to stay here and deal with it just so I can protect my daughter.

2o9jy4,"""...you could take a perfectly happy monkey, drop it in the chamber, and bring out a perfectly hopeless animal within half a week"" - Deborah Blum, ""Love at Goon Park"" Over the years, Harlow and his team developed countless schemes to test the effects of deprivation on primates.  By far the most disturbing ones, and the most applicable to this story, were the isolation experiments.  

In the most extreme of these, Harlow and his students designed a vertical, funnel-shaped contraption made of polished steel, which he nicknamed the ""pit of despair.""  In the wide bottom of this pit they placed baby monkeys.  

At first the infants would desperately try to escape, constantly running up the sides and slipping back down.  But after a few days, most were resigned to huddling at the bottom and hugging themselves.  According to Deborah Blum, ""you could take a perfectly happy monkey, drop it in the chamber, and bring out a perfectly hopeless animal within half a week.""  Harlow left his infants in the pit from anywhere from three to twenty-four months.  Each one emerged from this ""hell of loneliness"" withdrawn, depressed, and essentially psychotic.

At the time I was pretty wary of getting into a new relationship so quickly, but we just ""clicked"". We're so good together and love each other very much. We have a very healthy relationship. 

The only problem is that every time I say ""love"" I get this little doubtful twinge - I wonder whether it's really real, I wonder whether I can trust it. I loved my ex very much and leaving him took years - I'm not sure I trust ""love"" anymore. Can anyone else relate to this? Do you have any advice??

1tcchp,"I thought I had it contained...thought that I could control it, but it's been a year and a half and it's only gotten worse. For as long as I can remember, I have harbored some anger issues that crop up and stay for quite a bit before I am able to get it under control. This has been an issue for as long as I can remember, and I clearly remember a moment in my life when it really started.

I had been battling depression in my teens, but before then I had a sense of abandonment by my parents. I am definitely grateful for all they had provided for me, but in terms of guidance all I got was the silent treatment from my dad who traveled a lot and the degrade you and tell you you're worthless treatment from my also traveling mother.

The only real joy and sense of family that I ever had was the birth of my brother. He's my best friend and the only person that has ever sought to help me understand my rage.

For as long as I can remember, my mother has been abusive. She's either verbally assaulting you and tearing you down through poison laced words, or physically violent. I got over the physically violent bit because quite honestly she can't hurt me anymore. The words however hit deep and always hit hard. I spent a good 9 years of my life away from her personal contact through schooling but then I made a fateful decision to return home and help with the family business.

I could not have made a worse decision. I returned to a more hostile work environment than I could have ever imagined. This in turn made me lose control of my already precarious temper. It started small with snide comments and has now grown to outright bursts of anger to any hapless person in my line of sight. I'm losing control and I don't know how else I can control it.

I know it's bad, but I also know that even if I were to leave the situation or even try to find a way out, my mother's relentless personality and absolute refusal to compromise on any issue would only drive me farther from the family than I already am. My support net is far from me, and my brother has been preoccupied by a woman in his life. I'm reaching the end of my rope and I don't know where to turn.

Our story started a few years ago when we tried dating a three months... It was train wreak and the night I asked her out, there was crying, emotions, and lots of barriers put up.  She told me there would be no sex etc. 

I was ok with it, but she seemed to be not ok, with me being ok with it... (if that makes sense). And as we progressed through the relationship it became more and more harder to cope with. Until she broke down and we stopped talking one day... 

It was really sad, but after 3 years we reconnected and started hanging out again. We cut through the games and said that hopefully one day this will develop in to a healthy relationship, and that we would only be friends for now. So far its been really great for both of us. 

My question is, how do abuse victims see physical/sexual issues... Do they exist in their mind? Are they ""dirty/negative"" activities? Will they eventually develop into a healthy sexual activity?

q4htl,"DAE hate that part of recovering where you're supposed to 'feel your feelings'? Trigger warnings: ED, self-harm, abuse, etc. Hey there, just joined. 

I'm currently trying to learn how to feel my feelings, observe them non-judgementally, and then do something different from what I'd usually do. And I hate it. It's fucking hard. I've struggled with eating disorders and self-harm, but those are both things I'm not doing right now. Usually when I would have unpleasant feelings, I'd just go to those things. Now I either go to food (still struggling with over-eating), or just distract myself as much as possible until the feeling is less recognizable. I've obviously gotten better at 'dealing' in non-destructive ways, but I'm not actually dealing.

So like I said, what I'm working on in therapy right now is trying to
 recognize my feelings, not judge them, let myself feel them, and all that... and while it's all good in theory, and I understand why/how it works... I just can't do it. Does it get easier? Have you done it? Most of the bad feelings are in relation to abuse I've dealt with. I don't want to feel those things. I don't want to acknowledge them. I'd rather just ignore them every time the come up until they go away. But that doesn't happen. :\

So I'm just in a really awkward and uncomfortable spot. I don't want to feel bad things. Because feeling it is unpleasant. But also when I let myself really feel it, I freak the hell out. Crying, wanting to punch things, hurt myself, etc. I don't really like it when that happens, especially because I have roommates. And I don't want my stuff to be breaking. &gt;.&gt;

You throw away all of the opportunities you are given and take advantage of everyone around you with no remorse.

2jt8ec,"I need to purge my hostility and hate? Today, I got the biggest wake-up call of my life. I realized how much I can miss out on life by being so angry. 

Short story:

I applied for a web developer job for $20 an hour a couple of weeks back. I soon got a call and was scheduled for the following week. I was excited and hyped up the interview so much in my mind. I was studying every single day of the week making sure I had all of my knowledge right. I was well rested and groomed for the day. 

I walked into the interview room and there were 6 people interviewing me at once. They asked me various questions, and at one point I was being asked personal questions. 

""What game console do you own?""

""Well I have a tricked out, PC, a PS4, a---"" 

""Hey Brian! Do you still have that Xbox One?""

And then they would go off and have a conversation right in front of me as if they didn't care about me at all. I tried to adjust and sort of make it into their conversation but it just didn't work out for me.  And before I knew it, the interview was over. They said that they'd let me know next week. 

After the interview, I sent over follow up information and questions about the interview and they never gave me a real response. Which really angered me. 

After a week of anticipation I finally got the rejection email. And I was hit with a rave of wage. I sent: ""This was a piss poor interview process. This is probably for the best. Thanks anyways.""

And a week later I got an email stating that if I hadn't of said that, I would have gotten a call for another interview because their first choice fell through and that'd I'd be right there with the team laughing and having fun.

Main point: 

This isn't me being mad at them, this is me being mad at myself.  I wasn't always like this. About 6 months ago, I was the kind of guy who would let anything roll over his back and go on about my day. I would walk with a kick in my step everyday no matter what happened to me. 

But then I got laid off of my dream developer job. And the thing about it is that nobody ever cared, my supervisor who I thought I was friends with never called or emailed me. None of my co-workers cared and it was if I never mattered at all. And after I got back on my feet,  I got laid off again. And since then, I have felt as if something inside of me has been broken.

I loved what I was doing for those two jobs. I now do something I hate more than anything else. And I just can't seem to get another break. 

There are times when I think into the past and I get so angry that I can't even think about anything, then I eventually get fatigued and fall asleep.

And after what just happened to me, I have finally woken up and have seen what I have become. And then I look back and realize that this isn't who I am. I am much better than this. 

What do you guys do for your anger? And how do you guys get out of a slump like this?

236n2d,"A common problem of angry people People who are angry all the time have the problem of always expecting things to go their way. 

The world owes us nothing. Nothing is ours. We only falsely believe it to be, and then when we grasp at it as if it were ours, we suffer. We experience stress in any of it's many forms. Anger, agitation, sadness, etc. 

To cool down, and not be so angry all the time, we have to trace our anger back to our craving. Craving is what makes us want reality to go our way, and when it doesn't we stress. 

A few examples:

-you want to go for a smoke break but your boss asks you to work an extra 30 min. If you crave for that smoke break, and don't get it, you will stress. The harder you crave, the harder you will stress. All it takes is saying, it's no big deal, in a day or week it will be forgotten, and the stress is more harmful anyway. It's you who gets burned. 

-another example is driving in traffic. Someone cuts you off, and you freak out. You may have already been agitated, ticked off, and it sets you off the edge. But in reality it doesn't really matter, again in a day or week it will be past and forgotten. But often the consequences of our anger linger far longer than the anger itself. So instead just consider how quickly the anger arises and how it's up to you to choose to perpetuate it or cut it at it's root.


And that's the thing about anger. Think of it as a snowball. If you feed it, it grows. But by seeing you don't have to have reality go YOUR way, you don't stress because you don't put emphasis on your own greed. It's like smashing the snowball right there and then. 



So remember:

-anger comes from craving for things to go our way
-the universe owes us nothing, we foolishly think it does
-uproot anger altogether with right view (nothing is owed)

It will come down to your heedfulness. Pay close attention to your anger, where it comes from, how to eliminate it. Like any skill you will be better at it with time, practice and experience.

Anger is our own worst enemy. It does to us what our enemies would wish.

I'm doing extremely well, but currently am living in a pretty terrible neighborhood, and while I miss my son dearly, I can't feel right bringing him here. I'm seeing him outside, at the park, at some fun places in the area but worry about my ex around him.

He's always been the ideal father, really hands on and spoils him yet keeps him polite, as do I. I have worries, he has no support network. He keeps himself closed off from any emotional help and this morning he called me up sobbing. Begging to have me back(No, of course was my answer) and am worried of his mood taking a toll on our son.

Should I take him and bring him into this bad neighborhood? Should I just leave him around his father? We'll be in a new place in a better neighborhood by next month or so. Is waiting until them a bad idea?

1suds2,"I think I lost who I was and now I'm a monster My life used to be perfect. I could talk to girls, I was smart, and good at sports until I started dealing with a new high school. I loved my old school more than anything but this was some new opportunity for me and I'm not allowed to choose what I do in life. Anyways, from there, my life went down the toilet of reality so to speak. within approximately seven or eight months, my dad lost his job, my parents divorced, we lost our house, and I got diagnosed with ADD. I fell into an intense depression in which I almost ended my life like literally seconds from the final decision. I was going to this wicked expensive school because my Grandma wanted to pay for it. I was so greatful for that but I feel like I screwed her and myself by letting depression govern my life. I'm blamed it all on my mom, mostly because she had caused the marriage to decay and didn't give a shit about me and my sister. She could only afford 20 bucks worth of food and then go out clubbing on the weekends? She may work at a little dress shop but she makes way more than that and she still doesn't pay any bills. I was just so angry that I used to have random explosions where I punched through walls, tore up books, break glass, parade in the streets and fucking scream everywhere like I was insane and I literally had no control. They would tell me the next day and I wouldn't even remember it happening. I used to fill up notebooks of how much I hated myself and other people and plans to get rid of the people I hate. Now that shell is broken and I am in a brand new stage of anger that is way out of wack from anything I ever did. I realized all that shit was stupid and now that I've been couch hopping for the past five or so  months I decided that was all childish and useless. Now I have no emotions and I'm tough as a stone. A kid makes fun  of me they get a slug to the spleen. Someone calls me out in class I literally walk up to them and tell them to fuck off no matter who's looking. I slammed a kid's face off a locker for making fun of me because I am color blind. I'm done with psychologists and feelings. My new philosophy (which I rarely reflect on) is a sad existence but I feel like if I don't act like this then people think they will get to walk all over me. I rarely talk to girls anymore (none at my school) though I have alot of friends. I'm not afraid of death only just scared that it might take to long or something. My grades are ok but people think I'm stupid since I'm slow witted like a big dumb ox. Girls I like are so laid back and chill but now whenever I talk to one I feel so uptight and held back. Getting girls was so easy for me but now I wear my tough shell no matter who it is. People ask me what I am going to do with my life and all I want   to be is happy. I feel like I can only be this if I don't trust anyone else or take a risk. I feel like I'm becoming someone I'm not. For a long time I thought I had schizophrenia because I hear another voice in my head though it is not like a literal voice it's more of a second conscience.

1d47ax,"GRRRR Rant.. Ok, well I used to have a gf, we broke up on good terms because it was long distance and we wanted to get over stuff, nothing bad, we still talk. Here's the thing...when she was 16, she was drugged and raped at a party &amp; when she told me I convinced her to tell her mom &amp; the two guys went to jail. Before the rape, she used to have an abusive bf who forced her to have sex w/ her when she wasn't ready and let his friend join in. She told me this and the Swedish police (she's Swedish) didn't do anything since it was 2.5years ago. The thing is, she suffers from social anxiety, depression, anorexia, has extremely low self-esteem and more. I helped her with everything and now she's ok, except for the social anxiety for which she's seeing a counselor and therapist which is good. 

Here's the problem. She's an angel, she said she loves me and I help her forget about her past. Me, on the other hand can't believe the Swedish police is filled with such rotten maggot faced officers. As an armored officer in the reserves &amp; being a Type A personality dominant male. I want to kill everyone. I want to find her ex and his friend, kidnap and torture them to the point they don't know who they are. I want to l want to inject them with liquid adrenaline and then cut off their legs. Burn their tiny dicks and give them every fucking possible weaponized disease known to mankind and slowly watch them die and shit on their ashes. I want to drive a fucking tank into her rapists' cell and shoot them at point blank until the fucking country is covered in the pink mist that's left of their measly corpses.

I don't want to stop there. I want to fucking kill every measly cop in the fucking country and rip apart that stupid judicial system that failed the nicest person on the planet. I won't stop till I fucking lop off the head of that homosexual shit faced King who doesn't know how to run a fucking country like a man. I want to kill every fucking cop in Sweden and serve it as a lesson to the world to kill all the rapists in jail or at least burn their fucking bodies till they look like beetle dung.

I am not a nice guy and even when I catch someone looking at MY girl wrong I will come at you with a fucking machete and chop off your right arm for even thinking about looking at her. Fuck this world, ""A tub of red won't change the color of the sea""-found on Reddit. I want the fucking planet to burn and crumble into ashes for doing that to the one person that I care about and I will fucking destroy that stuck up country full of shit.

2x1xyf,"I don't really remember. My therapist told me I needed to remember my past in order to help my future. I guess that makes since. I mean, yeah. I'm not a doctor. Hell, I'm still in high school. Anyway, a couple of weeks ago I remembered something that I had, I don't know- maybe I had suppressed it? Or maybe I just forgot. I mean, it's still really hazy and I'm not sure if it's real or not. 
I started school at the usual age, about 5 or 6. I went to a small, private school. Actually, it was a catholic school, but that doesn't matter. There weren't a whole lot of kids at this school. Like maybe 40 kids in a grade, everyone knew each other really well. There was this one girl, Demi, who was basically the stereotypical 'mean girl' of our school. Everyone wanted to know Demi. Demi was better than you. Demi was, strangely, my best friend. We were polar opposites; while she stayed inside and played with her Barbies in frilly dresses, I would  be outside, knee-deep in mud, playing with the worms. 
Demi and I had a ton of sleep overs, and I mean a ton. It was like every weekend we went over to her house, two streets down from mine. She had everything. Her house was bigger, her mom nicer, her room was basically a princess'. She even had 4 older brothers, whilst I had one. Because Demi was so much better than me, she took advantage of me. I was the kid who acted tough but was scared of the dark. She joked around, telling me tons of ghost stories, and scared me for the rest of my life. 
One night we were playing downstairs, running around, when Demi decided, ""last one to my room is a rotten egg!"" As she bolted up her grand staircase, I huffed slowly behind. She was faster than me, and she knew it. I passed a bathroom and slowed, not stopping, and caught a glimpse of one of her brothers looking in the mirror, staring at his reflection. I sped up again, ignoring it. I didn't know her brothers very well, if at all. They were so much older than me. 
I finally made it to her room, to see her laying on her floor. 
""Finally! You're the rotten egg!"" She declared, laughing. I smiled, embarrassed for myself, and laid on her bed. She stood up and turned on her tv, probably to Disney channel or something. Now cold because of the change in location, I snuggled under her comforter. She lay on her window seat. I didn't notice her brother walk into the room, but I did notice as he picked up the comforter and slid next to me. 
God, I remember being so uncomfortable. I was in first grade, and this teenage boy, a teenage boy I didn't know, was laying beside me. I squirmed as he sat up, his arms under the covers. Demi looked over and smiled, but I frowned. 
The next part is really blurry. It's like a few dust particles are my memory and the maid just cleaned up. Basically, I'm pretty sure he handed me his penis. Fucked up, right? Anyway, being this naive kid, I started guessing what it was as I felt it under the covers. A hot dog? No. A weird pencil? No. Demi sat by, still on her window seat, as I was scared to death. I remember trying to stop him by playing it off as a joke, like ""ha ha, I don't know what it is!!"" I don't even remember if that worked, I don't really remember. Even as a kid, with no idea what was happening, I knew that wasn't right. Maybe that's why when I was 13 I showed my boobs to a couple of people, like it was no big deal.

1h055d,"Was physically abused, but never sure if I was sexually abused. Would this be considered sexual abuse? I've been going to a therapist recently after being diagnosed with PTSD. My father severely abused my siblings, my mother, and myself. Fast forward to my mom remarrying and supposedly I told my step-dad that I had been molested. Yet I don't even remember much of the abuse. 
Now I'm in college and have a boyfriend, and we are both sexually active. But since I've been going to the therapist and I told her that I was beaten terribly for masturbating at a young age (less than six y/o), she asked me if I was ever sexually abused. I don't know.

To add-on, I was kissed against my will as a high school sophomore and it, for some reason, shattered my world because I said no and the school did nothing about it. But somehow it screwed up the next few years for me. To me that should be an indicator of something. But I was taken to be checked a few years ago for sexual molestation/abused and there was no evidence.

We even asked my step-mother. She said the same about the masturbation but also claimed there was no sexual abuse.

This is ruining my sex life. I sit there and wonder why I can't really trust my boyfriend, can't relax around him, can't really perform or function sexually unless I am alone. I want sex with my boyfriend a lot, don't get me wrong, but every time I have the opportunity, I go from wanting it to sitting there, bored and waiting it out in a few minutes. Could shaming my masturbation habits at an early age really cause this? Or is there enough reason to think that I was really sexually abused? I don't know what to think anymore and it's really bothering me.

Moved in with eachother this summer after doing the long-distance thing.  Tentative plans to get married ""someday.""

He's always had a volatile temper, but having recently moved back in with eachother I find he is angrier than usual.  He gets extremely angry after I've done something small or mundane that he doesn't like (ex- asked him to take the dog out, made dinner later than when I told him it would be ready) and will swear at me- tell me to go fuck myself, call me a bitch, an asshole, a piece of shit.  Then five minutes later he will apologize, or maybe he will hang onto his anger and be angry at me for days.  If I don't apologize to him for my misstep, he will continue to berate me or give me lingering, rage-filled glares for days.  I feel like I'm walking on eggshells- I never know when he's going to blow up.  When he does blow up I can't say anything to defend myself or my actions, because this will fuel his rage and he will rant for longer.

I have told him that this is unacceptable, and that the next time that he calls me names or rants at me, that we are over... but he says that I shouldn't feel that way, this is just the way he expresses his anger, and that if he were to hold his rage back he would likely just do something worse.  So he continues to rant when he gets angry, and I try my best to ignore it.  He will take whatever I have done wrong and use it to justify his terrible behaviour, nomatter how small my mistake.

He has not physically abused me, although he has lightly pushed me or lightly smacked my hands when he has gotten angry (never enough to physically hurt me).

The thing is, he can be a very sweet boyfriend.  He will do tiny sweet things that he knows I will just love.  I feel like he gets me, and that I can really be myself around him. 

I'm not depressed, and have never been abused before.  To my knowledge neither has he. But reading online about verbal and emotional abuse, about 50% of the telltale signs that this is a verbal relationship are there.  This is very confusing for me.  If he's not displaying all the signs of a verbal abuser, and I'm not depressed, then what is this?  Should I be trying to fix this?

za0bz,"Just found this sub... In need of - Understanding. This sub doesn't seem to get much action, but I am introducing myself anyway.  I (28f) was being abused from Nov 2007 until my escape in April 2011.  We have a daughter together, who I was pregnant with when the abuse began.  I was hormonal and vulnerable because she is my one and only and I didn't want to be a single mother, so I put up with it.  I have scars from both the first time he put his hands on me, and the last time.  I can't rehash all the details right now because I am so wrapped up in my own mind I may have a psychotic break.  

As of today, I have been away from him for 17 months.  I have permanent damage because the last three days I was alone with him, I was locked in the bedroom getting punished for having cheated on him.  My left eye has a permanent black floater and occasional flashes of bright white light that has been told to me that is my retina partially detaching; I have clinical impingement in my right shoulder that causes pain from my left shoulder blade, up my neck and down my arm into my fingers; my ribs ache every time I try and get out of a partial sitting position.  I still have nightmares nightly, and paranoia that he is outside my door.  

Here is my main frustration today, aside from the PTSD, I cannot get his current whereabouts so that I can divorce his sorry ass.  He is currently being ""treated"" to regain competency for trial, and I have been ""advised"" that it would be a bad idea because it may disturb him too much and remain incompetent.  I hate that state.

tl;dr - the state is keeping me from getting divorced because he may be too disturbed and continue to claim he is incompetent to stand trial.

1wjt4y,"Took in abused friend for a couple days, need advice! Hey guys. This is my first post in this sub. I hope it's the right place for this. My friend (31F) is in a relationship with a very sick man. He is an alcoholic and is mentally ill. He has been jailed multiple times for drunken violent behavior towards strangers. He has also physically assaulted my friend in her home many times. My friend also has mental health issues and has abused drugs heavily in the past. 
Three days ago, I got a call from her before work saying that her boyfriend woke her up, accused her to trying to kill him, and slammed her head in a doorway. I told her to call the police and get out and come to my house for the day. She showed up with a huge gash in her forehead and she was bleeding everywhere. She won't talk to the police. She has insisted that she won't go to the hospital or a help center for battered women. So I offered my spare bed for the night. Her boyfriend was arrested later that day for drunken disorderly behavior in an unrelated incident. He has now been released.
I love my friend, but having her in my home has gotten stressful. Her depression is very deep, and all she has talked about is how her life is over and how nobody cares about her. She has been screaming and crying a lot, hysterically. She has also has bladder control issues, which have been another source of stress/shame for her. Her bad habits seem to get the better of her, in that she has been chain smoking inside my house until she goes to sleep.  I have been understanding of all this.
I know that this is a wall of text. What I want to know is if my creeping suspicion that I, 23F, may not be qualified to actually help my friend beyond giving emotional support. I am hesitant to ask for her to follow certain house rules or to ask her to clean up after herself if she has a bladder accident. It's as if she feels so horrible that she is pulling her surroundings into that horribleness.  But this is my home. I have a room mate about to move in today. I don't know what to say/do to change this situation into something positive where she is getting real help and I have my space to live safely and happily. I feel so selfish and guilty for wanting her to stay somewhere else, but don't I have to take care of myself too?  I'm generally a really happy and outgoing person, but the past few days I haven't seen any friends and haven't left my house except to run errands for her and to work. I have felt like I'm not allowed to be positive or happy at all.  Now I'm feeling kind of trapped.  I'm also worried that whe will eventually go back to her abuser for feeling like she is unwanted elsewhere. That is not what I want.
I could really use some advice/support.

I can finally accept that I have trouble going into detail: I was 14 and on the Wrestling team, and was usually harassed by 1 boy. 1 Day in the shower he agressively began touching me inappropriately and spanked me repeatedly. I was not, however, raped in any way.

For the past 4 years I've acted as if the event never happened, or it ""wasn't a big deal."" Because in the end of the day it's difficult, as a heterosexual male, to admit to myself that this happened.

Now I see that I was assaulted. It harmed my confidence, played a part in my development of Depression and Anxiety and made me ""Cold""; to this day I have never admitted this to anybody personally and have trouble opening up about certain things. 

I do, however, handle this day by day. What happened 4 years ago happened 4 years ago, and if I can't move past it I allow the abuse to continue.

1qc3iz,"Was physically abused by my husband last week. Don't know what to do. A bit of background: 
I came from an abusive childhood so upsetting behavior is more normal for me. 
My husband is an alcoholic and starting physically abusing me in 2008. It happened out of nowhere. When it happened he was not drunk but mostly continued to occur when he was. He strangled me at least a few times a week through out 2008 and in 2009 too. In 2009 I went to a hospital because I was seriously depressed. It was an hour away from where we lived and I gained a bit of independence. Afterwards I moved into an apartment near the hospital and stayed there for eight months. Then I felt guilty and went back to him.  He was very verbally abusive and still would break something in the following years or something of that nature but was not physically abusive towards me.  I would say physical abuse happened again in 2011/2012. 

Last Week:
He had gotten very drunk and I begged him to sleep in the same room with me because I was frightened. I got on top of him begging him to come into our room and he threw me to the ground. I sat on top of him again and my dog at that moment happened to poop. My husband took the poop and threw it on the hallway wall. He then took it and smeared it in my face, mouth and hair. Then he choked me for a few moments. I am devastated an so hurt.

Now:
We have no family here. So if he left and went back to where our families are, I would be here alone. That's what I'm so scared of. Being alone and that something bad will happen to me without him. Like I will lose my protection. I can barely function now and am thinking about quitting my seasonal part time job. I hate my life and need advice.

I emailed my sister asking her what she remembered about our childhood.   I told her of some physical and emotional abuse that happened to me as a young child and growing up and into adulthood. I wanted to know if anything happened to her, since she is 5 years older, and my brother is 7 years older than me.  

I had been no contact for many years prior to this with parents and sister. It stopped when both parents died in the last few years and she is the executor of the estate so I had to deal with her. I had a lawyer do it for a while, because she was not being accountable and doing her fiduciary duty.  That got her attention.

She wrote back saying ""The  kinds  of  things  you believe  that  you  remember  are  defamatory  to Mom  and  Dad  and  dishonor  their memory.  They  are  not  here   to  defend  their  honor  and  defend themselves  from  false  accusations.""

""It  is  my  belief  that  your  accusations   are  false  and  delusional.""


I feel like throwing up right now.  I am shaking and I can't believe that she would say this to me.  She wasn't there at the time, so she can't say it didn't happen! 

I think she caught the family narcissism bug. I'm worried she's passing it on to her children.  They are young adults now. 

She was also horrible to me and my brother.  I don't know what else to think other than our non- relationship will stay a non-relationship.

It just makes me sick to be called a delusional liar by someone with their head so far up their ass.

30zxks,"Hi. I need help with changing my last name (one of my abuser's last name) I creep in here on this account. I post in it on a throwaway or two. I am posting on this account now, because of the reason I am posting, I won't be anonymous anymore. A choice I had to make.

**First I'd like to open with, I checked the mods about posting this, they were fine with it.** 

I debated with posting this because of my issues with self-worth, and if I should really be asking anyone (on the internet) for help.

First my story:
http://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/29y5ht/probably_has_triggersmy_story/

Warning: I was in an emotionally charge state at the time I wrote that, and probably has triggers in it somewhere, read at your own risk.

Second:
I live paycheck to paycheck. I have debts that haven't been paid, because my rent takes priority, as does medication and other such things. I haven't bought groceries in two weeks, a friend bought me some two weeks ago, and my mother just bought me three weeks worth. But I have this incessant hatred of my last name. It reminds me of my neglect and abuse. People have told me to just ""change what it means to you"" but...well if I could do that I could just forget everything that happened to me. And I just need the reminder gone.

I'm posting this here because just posting it to my facebook friends and family won't cut it.

I need to change my last name. It reminds me of her, everyday. I hate hearing it, I hate seeing it, I hate it.

So I started a gofundme...GoFundMe... Go Fund Me? However you should write it.
I need $370 to change my name (probably a little more with getting fingerprints as is required in my state, maybe taxes or some shit, I don't know etc.)

1i50hk,"I would like some advice on how to best support a victim. I was just made aware of a situation involving my little sisters best friend and that friend's family. I will call my sister's friend Beth. Beth's parents have been in the process of a protracted divorce. (custody, property and shared business are all part of the legal fiasco.) The divorce is pretty messy, from what I understand, both parents are refusing to move out. Aside from allowing my sister and Beth to come hang out with my girlfriend and I at our apartment, I have kept my distance from the situation.

My little sister has left town for summer camp. Beth doesn't really have any friends aside from my sister, so I told her that if she needed anywhere to hang out, she is always welcome to come play video games and eat pizza with my girlfriend and I. I gave Beth my phone number, but didn't expect to hear from her. (I doubted that a 15 year old girl would call her friends 25 year old brother.)
Earlier today, Beth called and asked if it was ok for her to come by. When she arrived, she wasn't alone. Her mother had come as well. Her mother had bad bruising on her neck and fresh black eye.

I wont say I know her mother well, she is a nice woman who has an enormously successful career. I haven't asked very many questions, but she did confirm that her husband had hurt her. I have tried to be kind and supportive. I served them dinner and told them they are welcome to stay as long as they need. The mother is currently sleeping in my guest bedroom while Beth is playing portal and eating a disturbing amount of tortilla chips.

What do I do? What resources are best for this situation? Part of me wants to call the cops, but I'm not sure I can carry the burden of sending Beth's Dad to jail. I'm sure the divorce lawyer is going to notice these bruises so this isn't going to stay a secret. How do I support this little girl who just had to look after her own mother? I feel flattered that Beth would reach out to me for help, but also burdened by the responsibility of looking after her and her family. I don't want to intrude into their private life, but at the same time they came to my front door and part of me feels like I've just become very involved in this situation.

I've called the my local domestic violence support line and they've given me some rudimentary advice, but I feel I should be doing more. I would be grateful for any advice.

I should also say that I have a history of anger management issues and am finding it very difficult to resist the urge to go throttle the abusive fuckwit.

TL;DR: My little sisters best friend and her battered mother have shown up at my apartment in order to escape a violent situation.


**Update:** Yesterday I went to the police office with Beth' mother and filed a police report. Tomorrow morning I am driving them out of town to stay with some family members.  Thank you guys for sharing your stories and encouraging me. Special thanks to /u/TheDnBDawl for your advice about taking pictures. My girlfriend was able to talk Beth's mother into taking pictures and we put them onto a flash drive and gave it to the cops.

2js514,"So glad to find this sub. My wife left me because I abused her. I'm trying to do the right thing. Here's something I wrote a few months ago about one of my first group therapy sessions for abusive men. To save myself the trouble of reformatting everything, I'm going to link to the post on /r/DecidingToBeBetter:

http://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/280uzw/tonight_i_attended_a_group_therapy_session_for/

A lot has happened since that first session.  My wife hasn't filed for divorce, but we are separated, and communication is pretty sparse.  She's doing what she can to take care of herself and recover, and I'm just trying to be a healthy human.  

I'm still going to group therapy, and last week she attended a counseling session with me.  This whole thing has been really hard, and it's made me aware of all the dysfunction and abuse that goes unaddressed on a daily basis.  I see it everywhere in the way men talk to their wives or children in public.  

There's a terrible stigma for abusive men that is a barrier to recovery and rehabilitation, so I've tried to be open about what I'm going through.  I think that we need to heal abusers and create safe environments for rehabilitation, instead of shaming them.  When a man admits to abuse, he opens himself up to vitriol, usually from other men who may see themselves as protectors of the abused, but don't realize that they're perpetuating abuse themselves.

I'm going to write some updates on what's happened in the last 4 months, but I was excited to find this sub and share.

15utsw,"A friend privately disclosed to me that her boyfriend did some abusive things to her. Unsure how to proceed. **Apologies for length and verbosity.**

I am a 24-year old male with a long term friend. Let's call her ""Jane"". She's 22, and dating a 23-year old guy who we'll call ""Bob"". They've been together for three years. Living arrangements are separate.

We are fond of each other in a platonic way, and confide in each other often. However, about a year into their relationship, something in her changed. She started being less open with me, ending conversations at strange moments, blowing off plans for bizarre reasons, etc. So, I've known something was ""up"" for a while.

About a week ago, she contacts me. She confesses that the following happened with her boyfriend:
&gt; Well we got in a fight and I ended up on the floor sooo needless to say we took some time apart

I ask for some details and she tells me:
&gt; Yeah. I got pushed across the hall and end up on the bathroom tile fucked up my hip and hit my head.

I was never fond of the guy, but this makes me hate him. So much. I can assure you, ""Jane"" isn't the kind of person who would make something like this up. 

The problem is that they're still together. She insists that he's ""not like that"" and that it ""came out of nowhere"". I don't really know what to do. I have a few questions:

1. Every time she mentions him, I get this intense upset feeling in my stomach. How do I deal with this? He's her boyfriend, so he's very much a part of her life. I can't avoid him.
2. How do I know if he really ""isn't like that"" or not?
3. Is there anything I can do to politely find out more from her? She's unusually reserved about the topic. 
4.

1943mv,"Does anyone else have no contact at all with any family members (close or extended)? I was just wondering if anyone here also has no contact at all with any of their biological family.

 What do you do when people ask about your relations? I feel like such a freak. It always comes up because I'm an immigrant and English is my second language. I have an accent that makes people curious and the usual small talk/introduction questions go like this: Where are you from?  Do you miss your family back home? Do you visit often?

I just don't know what to say at that point? No I don't visit them. No I don't plan to visit. And then I get weird looks from people, as in, what's wrong with you? How could you do that? I can't give them an answer.

 I am an only child and I left my home country when I was 12. My parents abused me and I was never close to any of the other relatives. Leaving the country was my mother's way of severing ties forever and ensuring she did not have to care for her own aging and extremely abusive mother. My father was similarly estranged from his parents.

I feel like such an outsider all the time. Forever a foreigner, forever alone. I have a lot of trouble making friends because I can't get past that first casual conversation without things getting weird and awkward. It's horrible. I don't have any Russian friends either. They would especially judge me for breaking ties with my mother and relatives back home. That's forbidden, taboo, you can't do that. I don't know what to do. I have some friends online and I am friends with my roommate and that's it. 

 I would like to have friends in real life I could talk to and hang out with (my roommate and I do sometimes but it's sort of weird, I feel like he only does it because he feels sorry for me and not because he actually likes spending time with me.)

33kp07,"The black sheep. Okay, so I don't really know how to do this so I'm going to just jump right into it. I am the second oldest of seven children. My parents started very young and for years I've justified the things they did to us (mostly me) because of that fact. I am having trouble facing it. The problem is, even though I'm an adult now and on my own, the emotional abuse has continued and I don't know how to deal with it. I find myself angered and saddened by it. I have often times gone to my parents home with the intention of confronting them but I always crumble. Even when we start to talk about it and I begin to talk about when they'd throw my by my hair or tell me they think it's funny when I cry, they always convince me it's okay or I deserved it. I don't know how to confront it or if it is even worth confronting. The thing is, it doesn't matter what they did, my whole family sees my parents as saints or justified because they had so many kids. I keep justifying it and it just kills me inside. Three years ago I almost killed myself because they had me convinced I was a pile of shit and a waste of life. My mother has always been good at going for the throat. My father tended to be more physical. As time went on and I got older they began to convince me that if I reported them I'd go into foster care and get abused worse and likely raped and should be grateful I  had the parents I did. I am having a lot of trouble processing all the things they did to me and the fact that it was mostly targeted at me. There were six other kids, what did I do that was so wrong? I just don't understand. I guess I'm looking for help. I've never really openly talked about my abuse from my parents. It doesn't seem to get me anywhere when I try. Just had to get it off my chest tonight I guess. Sorry. It's just that I've always felt alienated by them and controlled. Not just my parents either, my siblings too. I guess I've just never really had a place where I belonged with my family. Until I left my parents house it didn't even feel like I had a home to go home to. I have just always felt like the black sheep and my family has made sure to keep it that was even as I've become an adult. They even used to call me excludey.

r7tra,"I finally told my mom about my abusive ex- the first thing she did was ask me if I left him immediately. I told the truth and said no. She was incredibly disappointed in me. Then she asked me if he did it more than once, I lied and said no. I feel so weak, like I should have stood up to him sooner and got out immediately. 

My friends ask me that all the time- ""why didn't you leave?"" I honestly don't know. It never really crossed my mind. I thought I had it all under control. He never really hit me- he did throw me down the stairs in his house more than once. Instead, he humiliated me. He made me take showers after he coerced me into having sex. And he'd just stand there, with the curtain open, watching me. He'd leave the bathroom and when I came back to his bedroom, my clothes would be in a pile outside his door. 

He would call me a stupid whore and a disgusting slut because we weren't actually in a relationship. Though it might as well have been. He was jealous and controlling. He demanded to know where I was and who I was with. If I ever even talked to another guy, even if he was just a friend, he would call me a dirty slut and told me no one wanted me-he didn't even want me. He tolerated me.

I finally drew the line one night. We were going to meet up with some friends that night. I was texting him about the plans for the night. Then he told me he was bringing another girl along. On a date. He ended that text with ""so we need to be on our best behavior while she's around."" I was pissed, and told him so over the phone. I wasn't mad because he was seeing someone else.

vuvrx,"Sexual abuse victim, triggered hardcore. How do you calm down? I was sexually abused by my father's step-father. I called him my grandfather, I used to spend the night at his house when I was a child. He molested me, raped me. The earliest memory I've ever recovered was when I was 5, but he did things to my sister when she was 3, so there could be things I don't remember. He's the scum of the earth, in other words.

I got into therapy when I was 14, told everyone, got the CPS report done. Never went to court. Just cut him out of our lives.

I've been needed to get back to a therapist for a while now, to deal with anxiety and depression, social anxiety issues. I thought I was over this, and that just makes this entire thing worse.

You see, I have a summer job with a state transportation department. I watch construction crews pave roads, so I travel to every county in my department's district, working 14 to 17 hours a day. I don't get comp time or any time off unless I'm dying and need to see a doctor or I requested that time during the job interview.

I'm working in the town that he still lives in.

I could be working on the road that he drives on.

I could see this bastard in real life for the first time in 5 years, rather than just the nightmares.

I freaked right the fuck out when we hit the city limits, and I started remembering places from when my parents would drive through the town to his house.

I don't want to tell my co-workers. I don't want to freak out worse. I don't want this, but I don't think there's any way to get out of this. I thought I was actually stable, and that just makes this freaking out even worse.

I felt like I was going to throw up and start crying and screaming, but I just held it all in until we paved outside of the city limits. That's when I was able to relax a little bit more, because I had to focus on the road a lot more. I was sure that I would see him, because he used to work with the department and retirees are always coming up to pester the workers. And if I see him, I will kill him. I will get a pickaxe from the workers and just fucking kill him.

And I'm shaking now, just writing this. I have been trying not to flip out ever since hearing that we would be in that town. But I've become really withdrawn, everyone has noticed. That's not good for my job, especially when I had just begun to talk more, and they still thought that I was way too quiet.

But, I need coping techniques. I'm scared stiff and triggered and I don't know what to do. I just need to get through 3 days, just three days of working in this town and calming the fuck down after it.

With these hours, I can't see a therapist, and it's all I can do to keep functioning after a few 17 hour days in a row. And I felt like I was doing so well, that I was actually close to sane, and now this happened and it feels terrible.

10vkw0,"Emotional,Physical and Psychological abuse at the hands of my Brother. Hey.

I'm a 19 year old Male living in Australia.
My brother has always had a bit of an anger issue, ever since he was a kid. If he didn't get his way he always had a tantrum and things were always better. I think it's shaped him into the monster he is today.

My brother is two years older than me, and ever since we were young he used his strength and age to over-power me to force me to do whatever he wanted. Over the years, him getting whatever he wanted and being able to over-power me lead him to beat me, verbally and emotionally abuse me and has driven me to depression, anxiety, panic attacks and two suicide attempts.

He has beat me with, a broom, a computer chair, an iron and anything else within reach.

Last year, I ended the physical abuse by being strong enough to turn it around against him, and he hasn't raised his hand to me since, however I am always fearful he will again.

My Father helped balance the family life here, but he left two years ago after my brother attempted to hit me with a dumbell because I left the shower mat down. (something which he himself does all the time)
After my mother defended him, Dad left, and I've hardly seen him since then. 

Now that the physical force used against me has stopped, it has become far more sinister and twisted. He has been waiting in the dark for me to leave my room at night, told my mother I attempted to stab him and turning the power off, and the internet off intermittently when he doesn't get his way. He also listens in on my phonecalls, enters my room when I'm away (despite the fact that there is a lock, he must have a copy of my key), records me whenever I'm doing anything he disagrees with (cooking at 10pm) and vandalizing my property.

I am old and mature enough now to know that after a physical confrontation, calling the police will solve my problems for the most part. But now that he cannot over-power me, I do not know what I am to do. I cannot afford to move out, and all of my free time I hide in my room for fear of ridicule or anything else.

What can I do to someone who is no longer physically abusive, when my Mother will not intervene/ her intervention (which is not much) has not yielded any results from a spoilt child?

I looked in to what government payments I can get if I have to leave, but I can only acquire those after I have been forced out of my home.
And the last thing I want to do is leave my home.

Are there any strategies I can implement to help myself? Is there anything I can do to help my Mother realise that my brother's behaviour is far from normal?

Can you think of anything to help me?

30vktd,"Need advice from other survivors of incest I don't want to make this post too long so I'm going to give highlights of my story, just ask if you want to know more. My brother who is four years older than me used to molest me, perform oral sex on me and force me to touch him when I was 13 and 14. The only reason it stopped is because he went away to the military when he was 18. 
I blocked out the memories of this happening until I was 17. One day when I was sitting in class it all came back to me and I started hysterically crying and was sent to see the school social worker. She convinced me to press charges against him, so the police became involved. Unfortunately since it happened so long ago, there  was no physical evidence and nothing could be done. 
I've seen dozens of therapists over the years and am currently in therapy now. The hardest thing for me to deal with is that my parent's maintain a relationship with my brother despite the terrible things that he did. For the most part, my parents and I have had a great relationship. But I'm finding it harder and harder to even be around them. At times, I hate them for continuing to talk to the person that did such awful things to me. I'm also angry at them for not noticing that he was abusing  me when we were kids.

I shared that by that belief I am a bad person because of the abuse I endured, when in actuality, I feel that I am a good person and NO ONE deserves to be abused. My teacher pulled me aside and thanked me for sharing and told me that my story was beautiful.

1ncxgc,"How Can I Help My Abused Mom? Background:
My dad did some really horrible emotionally abusive things to my mom when they were married. My mom has always been an emotionally dependent type, she was married to my dad for 10 years, and they have been divorced for 10 years since then. The divorce was not mutual, and she begged him to stay for years after that.

Problem:
My mom was extremely depressed for a few years after the divorce, and she is still depressed now, but not to the point where I think she will do something dangerous to herself.

It's not as if she has given up trying to get over my dad, she has tried several psychiatrists, meds, support groups, she reads books from authors who were abused almost every week, but she has been running out of energy. She says she is too emotionally obsessed and doesn't have the strength that the survivors in these books possess.

There was one time her depression went away, that was when she had a brief relationship with one of her coworkers who turned out to be an asshole who was cheating with his wife and eventually ended up breaking up with my mom as she was just a mistress. I think if she found someone extremely successful she could get over my dad, but the problem is she has been dating for about two years with no luck. Lots of guys are interested in her, but she's not interested in them because they lack something she saw in my dad (they have to be extremely amazing at something). She says she could be happy if she had a relationship with one of these men, but only after she got over my dad. If she doesn't find a person who she can't ""shove in my dad's face"" to prove to him that he was wrong about her, she won't be happy, and it seems that she might not find this person for the rest of her life.

My mom is the kindest person I have ever met, and she doesn't deserve this, but after all of these years of trying to help her I haven't been able to come up with anything, and it makes me extremely upset.

I know that leaving him was the best decision. I'm well aware of how lucky I am to be alive, yet my scumbag brain constantly contradicts itself, feeling every extreme feelings all at once. I hate it. Why can't I just focus on the negative aspects of that unhealthy relationship? Why do I dream about the good times?

He might not have really loved me, but I definitely loved him, even when he threw glass at me or hit me. I just wanted to help him fight his demons. I wanted to give him the second, third, fourth, and fifth chances when no one else would. I wanted to save him. 

I know I can't save him. I can't save anyone but myself.

I was working on my car in my garage and I see my neighbor pull into his driveway.  I hear ""get the f*** out of my car"" and at first I thought it was from his radio as it was pretty loud.

Then I see the passenger door is open on his car and the girl stands up, he's out of the car.  He yells at her and she says something, not sure what.  Then he grabs her arm for a split second an she drops something.  He picks it up and walks inside and yells at her to come in.

She walks up to the door and all I see is him reach out and grab her by the neck and pull her in.  At this point she is screaming and sounds terrified.  He then shuts the door and that's it.

I didn't see him hit her and she did walk up to his front door voluntarily.  I also could not make out what they were arguing over.  It is very possible one or both saw me and I was the only one around.

I'm afraid if I report it that she'll not feel safe talking to me or coming for help.  In addition to that, although I live in a decent neighborhood, this guy might be bad news.  As in organized crime.  Different vehicles coming and going, perfect lawn, and cameras all over.

So...I'm also kind of afraid of what kind of crap might start happening to me.  I guess that's selfish.  Had I witnessed any kind of beating or heard any direct threats I would not hesitate at all to get involved or call authorities.  But as it is kind of borderline I'm not sure what to do.  Pretty sure he beat her ass inside but I have no way to prove it.  I don't know either of them at all and it's unlikely I'll see her face anytime soon.  Even if I did it would be from a distance.

In addition to that, there is an age gap with these two.  She looks in her twenties and he looks in his mid/late forties.  Could be a daughter, but I'd be willing to bet they are in a relationship.

What's the general rule of thumb on things like this? If I file a report can it be anonymous?  I'd like it to at least be on record but I don't want my name attached.",abuse,"['possibly', 'witnessed', 'abuse', 'heard', 'neighbor', 'couple', 'arguing', 'today', 'witnessed', 'incident', 'sure', 'anything', 'working', 'car', 'garage', 'see', 'neighbor', 'pull', 'driveway', 'hear', 'get', 'f', 'car', 'first', 'thought', 'radio', 'pretty', 'loud', 'see', 'passenger', 'door', 'open', 'car', 'girl', 'stands', 'car', 'yells', 'says', 'something', 'sure', 'grabs', 'arm', 'split', 'second', 'drops', 'something', 'picks', 'walks', 'inside', 'yells', 'come', 'walks', 'door', 'see', 'reach', 'grab', 'neck', 'pull', 'point', 'screaming', 'sounds', 'terrified', 'shuts', 'door', 'see', 'hit', 'walk', 'front', 'door', 'voluntarily', 'also', 'could', 'make', 'arguing', 'possible', 'one', 'saw', 'one', 'around', 'afraid', 'report', 'feel', 'safe', 'talking', 'coming', 'help', 'addition', 'although', 'live', 'decent', 'neighborhood', 'guy', 'might', 'bad', 'news', 'organized', 'crime', 'different', 'vehicles', 'coming', 'going', 'perfect', 'lawn', 'cameras', 'also', 'kind', 'afraid', 'kind', 'crap', 'might', 'start', 'happening', 'guess', 'selfish', 'witnessed', 'kind', 'beating', 'heard', 'direct', 'threats', 'would', 'hesitate', 'get', 'involved', 'call', 'authorities', 'kind', 'borderline', 'sure', 'pretty', 'sure', 'beat', 'ass', 'inside', 'way', 'prove', 'know', 'either', 'unlikely', 'see', 'face', 'anytime', 'soon', 'even', 'would', 'distance', 'addition', 'age', 'gap', 'two', 'looks', 'twenties', 'looks', 'mid', 'late', 'forties', 'could', 'daughter', 'would', 'willing', 'bet', 'relationship', 'general', 'rule', 'thumb', 'things', 'like', 'file', 'report', 'anonymous', 'would', 'like', 'least', 'record', 'want', 'name', 'attached']"
301sfu,"I think I was abused as a child.... When I was very little, my parents used to hit me a lot. Sometimes, it was because I started a fight. Most of the time though, it was because of bad grades or ""out-if-line"" behavior.

When using their hands wasn't enough, my folks got creative. First, it was a paddle. Then, it was a spatula. Sometimes, it was the rolling pin. Once, it was the gardening shovel. Another time, I believe it was a hose. My mom locked me outside once because I traveled too far on my scooter. I spent at least 30 minutes to two hours banging on the door, begging. Then, when she pulled me back it, it was a violent yanking. She then beat the everloving shit out of me, told me to always ask for permission first and never acting out of line. Regularly, she would strip me of my pants and beat me with a paddle. She did a lot of heavy hitting for grades too. That's why I'm so fucking terrified of getting Cs, Ds, and even Bs. Straight A for me.

Thankfully, all of this stopped years ago.

Still, to this day, I feel a horrible sense of worthlessness and self-hatred. I didn't know happiness *wasn't* a selfish thing until enough people pointed it out to me. I need to suffer on behalf of others to understand their pain.

There is something a friend of mine linked to me: a condition known as ""learned helplessness"". I don't know how much this might correlate to my situation, but I felt like sticking it on here.

The biggest problem is, my mom *did* care for me! She spent sleepless nights when I was sick, came to pick me up whenever I couldn't stay at school... I just... I don't know how I feel... It'd be one thing if I hated them outright, but I *don't!*

23hqrg,"Overcoming abuse, years later (throwaway) Im not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I wanted to share my story for the first time In my life.

Living with my father was a nightmare. 

He was an addict, an alcoholic, felon, sex offender, and just crazy.

You think ""Whats going on in the background?"" or ""Can you turn that down""
are uncomfortable questions, try ""What happened to your face?"" or ""Is that blood?""

I don't like to talk about my father. No that's not true. I love to talk about my father who
he is, what he does. 
It distracts from the real subject, what he did to me. 

What he did cant be undone. It cant be fixed. As time goes on it will get better, but never go away.
Ill always have the scars he gave me. 

For many years I was angry. Completely unable to find peace, to find any shred of happiness inside.
I faked it, I acted the way people expected me to, eventually I found comfort in letting go and just 
allowing myself to be carried by flow. If I lived completely in the moment, I didnt have to think about the past
I didnt have to prepare for the future. I could just exist. But that couldnt last. A complete lack of thought about
the future eventually leads to many more problems. 

Gradually I was able to gain my life back. To be in control of my own choices, my own emotions. Ill probably
always be bitter, and at times angry, But thats not all I am any more. I have hopes now, dreams even. I have
goals in life other than seeing tomorrow. I can finally address that while these things define me, they are only 
a part of who I am, not all I am. I have confidence in my self now, Im no longer afraid of everything. I still get 
uneasy when Im in a room and someone closes the door behind us, still panic a bit when someone suddenly reaches for something
out of sight. But it doesnt rule me any more.",abuse,"['overcoming', 'abuse', 'years', 'later', 'throwaway', 'im', 'sure', 'right', 'sub', 'wanted', 'share', 'story', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'living', 'father', 'nightmare', 'addict', 'alcoholic', 'felon', 'sex', 'offender', 'crazy', 'think', 'whats', 'going', 'background', 'turn', 'uncomfortable', 'questions', 'try', 'happened', 'face', 'blood', 'like', 'talk', 'father', 'true', 'love', 'talk', 'father', 'distracts', 'real', 'subject', 'cant', 'undone', 'cant', 'fixed', 'time', 'goes', 'get', 'better', 'never', 'go', 'away', 'ill', 'always', 'scars', 'gave', 'many', 'years', 'angry', 'completely', 'unable', 'find', 'peace', 'find', 'shred', 'happiness', 'inside', 'faked', 'acted', 'way', 'people', 'expected', 'eventually', 'found', 'comfort', 'letting', 'go', 'allowing', 'carried', 'flow', 'lived', 'completely', 'moment', 'didnt', 'think', 'past', 'didnt', 'prepare', 'future', 'could', 'exist', 'couldnt', 'last', 'complete', 'lack', 'thought', 'future', 'eventually', 'leads', 'many', 'problems', 'gradually', 'able', 'gain', 'life', 'back', 'control', 'choices', 'emotions', 'ill', 'probably', 'always', 'bitter', 'times', 'angry', 'thats', 'hopes', 'dreams', 'even', 'goals', 'life', 'seeing', 'tomorrow', 'finally', 'address', 'things', 'define', 'part', 'confidence', 'self', 'im', 'longer', 'afraid', 'everything', 'still', 'get', 'uneasy', 'im', 'room', 'someone', 'closes', 'door', 'behind', 'us', 'still', 'panic', 'bit', 'someone', 'suddenly', 'reaches', 'something', 'sight', 'doesnt', 'rule']"
2rp7q3,"Domestic Violence I dated this man for two years. Took a one year break when domestic violence started to take place. After that year I submissively took him back. Surprisingly I thought everything was just peachy. No violence and genuine care and passion. 
Awhile back I had told him about Reddit. Seeing as I used it a lot when I first met him he went and got one. Well ever since he's always used it and in which I have no problem. But I currently found him talking to foreign women to become pen pals, asking women to live with him in the near future, and even asking to meet up with strangers in our cities for coffee. While we were restarting a good cycle of dating. 
I genuinely feel awful beyond belief that I ever took the time to take him back and I'm trying to show him what it feels like to have all your hard work diminished. That's why I'm hoping if anyone wants to message me and help me flag him or help Reddit terminate his account so he loses not only me but the people he decided to speak to over me.

19ssyr,"How Can I Help a Friend When I Live Hours Away? My sister's close friend since childhood is being abused. She called and told my sister that her husband had been hitting her. I am heartbroken but not exactly surprised - he has been grooming her for this for YEARS and I saw it coming well before they were married. Prior to meeting him, she had been in an abusive relationship w/ her son's father. Her self-confidence (which was always shaky) was destroyed. She worked very hard and was able to buy a home for her and her son, even though she didn't make great money and got no financial support for their son from her ex. Then she met this asshole.

He (""husband"") is either a preacher of some sort or evangelical. As his main job, he is a parole officer. Our friend's father committed suicide years ago, and husband was terrible. Our friend is Catholic, and he was putting her down and her family down in this difficult time for saying the rosary, going to mass, etc. At this point, they weren't married and she still had her own home. They broke up.

Somehow they got back together, got married, and she got pregnant almost immediately. Of course she left her home she'd work so hard for to move with him one county over. She quit her job to take care of the kids and is now going to school herself. Husband has escalated years of emotional abuse to physical. He tells her that if she leaves, she will never get custody because he knows so many judges and lawyers, plus she doesn't have a job.

That's where things are right now. I don't think her family has been the greatest at supporting her - it is a large family though and she is closer w/ some siblings than others. My sister lives in our hometown, one county over from our friend. I am about two hours away.

My sister and I are hot-tempered but we know better than to go running off at the mouth at him and putting our friend and her kids in danger. My sister's husband is a police officer, not that it matters here, other than having rank over a parole officer.

What can we do? Are there actual steps we can take in preparation to help her leave (without forcing it on her) or do we just have to wait to see where the chips fall? I know she has a sibling where I live, and I am willing to all I can to help her get in school here and find child care and housing. Supposedly she is working with the abuse shelter in her area.

Any advice would really be appreciated. I worry so much that if this goes on and escalates as it has, that he may kill her and their kids.",abuse,"['help', 'friend', 'live', 'hours', 'away', 'sister', 'close', 'friend', 'since', 'childhood', 'abused', 'called', 'told', 'sister', 'husband', 'hitting', 'heartbroken', 'exactly', 'surprised', 'grooming', 'years', 'saw', 'coming', 'well', 'married', 'prior', 'meeting', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'w', 'son', 'father', 'self', 'confidence', 'always', 'shaky', 'destroyed', 'worked', 'hard', 'able', 'buy', 'home', 'son', 'even', 'though', 'make', 'great', 'money', 'got', 'financial', 'support', 'son', 'ex', 'met', 'asshole', 'husband', 'either', 'preacher', 'sort', 'evangelical', 'main', 'job', 'parole', 'officer', 'friend', 'father', 'committed', 'suicide', 'years', 'ago', 'husband', 'terrible', 'friend', 'catholic', 'putting', 'family', 'difficult', 'time', 'saying', 'rosary', 'going', 'mass', 'etc', 'point', 'married', 'still', 'home', 'broke', 'somehow', 'got', 'back', 'together', 'got', 'married', 'got', 'pregnant', 'almost', 'immediately', 'course', 'left', 'home', 'would', 'work', 'hard', 'move', 'one', 'county', 'quit', 'job', 'take', 'care', 'kids', 'going', 'school', 'husband', 'escalated', 'years', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'physical', 'tells', 'leaves', 'never', 'get', 'custody', 'knows', 'many', 'judges', 'lawyers', 'plus', 'job', 'things', 'right', 'think', 'family', 'greatest', 'supporting', 'large', 'family', 'though', 'closer', 'w', 'siblings', 'others', 'sister', 'lives', 'hometown', 'one', 'county', 'friend', 'two', 'hours', 'away', 'sister', 'hot', 'tempered', 'know', 'better', 'go', 'running', 'mouth', 'putting', 'friend', 'kids', 'danger', 'sister', 'husband', 'police', 'officer', 'matters', 'rank', 'parole', 'officer', 'actual', 'steps', 'take', 'preparation', 'help', 'leave', 'without', 'forcing', 'wait', 'see', 'chips', 'fall', 'know', 'sibling', 'live', 'willing', 'help', 'get', 'school', 'find', 'child', 'care', 'housing', 'supposedly', 'working', 'abuse', 'shelter', 'area', 'advice', 'would', 'really', 'appreciated', 'worry', 'much', 'goes', 'escalates', 'may', 'kill', 'kids']"
1dbw7b,"I just feel crazy all the time Hello, I m new here, i found my way here after a lot of searching. 

I just want to get this off my chest. I was sexually abused since the age of 3 or 4 by my grandfather on my mom's side and a few of my cousins who were a little older than me on my dad's side. my grandpa died when i was 5 but my cousins kept molesting me until I was 13. My dad was verbally and physically abusive towards me and my mom simply because we are female. My mother was never there for me emotionally so I had to grow up young. I went to counseling a few years ago and thought I was over everything, but I'm far from over it. 

I notice that i have rage and anger far more than what is considered normal. I have full on temper tantrums and I feel crazy and I fee like the crazy girlfriend when I blow up on my bf. It's not fair to him but i can't stop. I get irritated easily, but then other times I am super happy and enthusiastic and hyper. Maybe I have bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder. My grandfather had bipolar disorder so it's not far fetched. I heard that if abuse happens when someone is really young, then that person may not know how to handle emotions like an adult. I feel like that person. My emotions are intense and it takes over me. Like a few hours ago my bf promised to come over after work and I have been looking forward to seeing him for 2 days. He didn't end up coming over and I was so mad. The anger was intense and it just takes over me. I don't know how to explain where this anger comes from and I never know how to deal with it. All of my emotions are intense. Especially the negative ones like shame, guilt, embarrassment, and sadness. I am afraid of becoming the abuser.

 I am worried about going to counseling again because it brings up all the old emotions like shame, anger, guilt, and self hatred. I think my boyfriend is going to break up with me because of how crazy I can get and I'm terrified about it. I always blame myself for everything and I don't like myself and sometimes I think about suicide, but I wouldn't act on it.

I don't know where I'm going with this post but it feels good to let it out and just talk about it anonymously.

I feel like I have a disorder somewhat close to tourettes because I will be walking somewhere and not be necessarily angry, but since all of this shit is built up inside me, I will just have the urge to start screaming or start running.  I also have compulsions to vandalize cars or break windows of store buildings.  Breaking glass has a weird affect on calming me down.

Well to start off I am 22 and I use to be able to deal with just about any problem... but in the last 8 months or so I've been angry all the time. When I say all the time i mean there is at least something every single day. Today for instance I had a friend/co-worker come up to me place his ass in my face and fart right in my face. I know some of you are probably laughing at it, as am I for how ridiculous it was. That's besides the point there were 9 other people in the room when I asked the guy what his problem was, I got flak from the other 9 saying ""dude it was just a joke calm down"". Anyway with my rising anger issues over the past year it just sent me into a dark abyss of rage. I am just now starting to relax about it. If you are curious about what I said/did, the same thing I have been doing. I just shut up and stuck to myself, after I was accused of overreacting because I was upset about it.

1et6yt,"Angry with authority..sort of. Details inside. So, I work in a aerospace factory running two CNC lathes.  I run on average about 90 to 110% production per machine.

Boss constantly nags about shit not being done and that in taking too long to do stuff.  Most recently -- I was given a development job that needs the program debugged.  Back story on that -- I have around a year total CNC lathe experience and 9 years before that on manual lathes.  Now the fun part begins -- I'm not fast enough at debugging the program.  I'm technically a setup operator..  Not a programmer.  Its like nothing I do satisfies these cocksmokers and I'm in the verge of losing my shit.

Anger management doesn't help -- went through it in high school.  What options do I have other than telling my job and boss to fuck off?

I honestly believe most of my anger stems from social anxiety.  (Undiagnosed -- highly suspected). Is it likely some sort if low dosage anti anxiety meds will help or am I doomed to bashing my bosses face in with a boring bar?

1p2mms,"Untreated Childhood Trauma &amp; Abuse When I was about 6 years old, I was a victim of sexual abuse by an older teenage relative. This went on for a few months after school, maybe a year. At the same time, I was peeing in my pants, probably because of the abuse. This in turn led to severe physical punishment by a parent, although there was other physical abuse not related to this either.

Anyways, this was almost 30 years ago. I was taken to therapy for a few months, but I think there's still a lot of residual trauma. I don't get pissed off that any of this stuff happened to me, and I'm trying to take responsibility for my life. At the same time, depression, substance-abuse, etc. etc. just keep creeping their way into my life. I never found it hard to be intimate with others, sexually or otherwise, until recently.

2t5chd,"How do I burst their bubble? Obtuse Relatives. My relatives live in a world of sunshine and rainbows when it comes to the abuse and neglect I was subjected to by my parents.

Theres this impression that Im an immature, spoiled brat who ran away from home out of pettiness (ie after a bad argument/etc). Long story short, I escaped.
Furthermore, they seem to have the misguided opinion that I should have put up with it because hey, thats what family is for right? 

This has been something I've been struggling with on and off and I really want to put the final nail in this coffin once and for all. Whenever I bring up the topic of how abusive my parents were, they're all like ""forgive them"" or ""they love you"" or ""they miss you"" or some cheesy cliche like that. Like if I swallowed that bullshit, it would make everything better or that its my fault they treat me like something to be swept under a rug.

Furthermore, they are of the mindset that hitting your kids is the same as raising them, and is somewhat loosely tied to religious beliefs. So theres ANOTHER stonewall Im facing.

I just want them to understand that my parents are monsters, that this really happened and that they cant keep trivializing me like this.
They dont want to talk about it, they dont want to face it, and they always brush it aside like an ""its not them its me"" sort of thing.

Dont get me wrong, willful ignorance isnt their only problem, there are some of my relatives who actually understand my situation but use it to hurt me, as per our interactions in my attempts to reconnect with them. One reaction was where I was basically called a child while another encouraged me to repress what had happened to me. 

This is the mindset of my ""family"".

2r3yh5,"I have a question. (Possible triggers) I want to know why people are accusing me of lying. I was abused by my father and raped by a family member and then years later a stranger drugged me and raped me (wasn't a date so I'm not sure the term date rape applies). I didn't talk much about what my father did but it was known he was evil and I  never said a word about either rape for a long time. I started talking a couple years ago and mostly got support about the stranger one which I came out with first. Last spring I told my husband about the family one and he encouraged me to talk to my mother. The support on that one ends there. My brother called me a liar, my step dad said nothing, my aunt listened and hasn't spoken to me since and neither had the rest of the family. My in laws screamed in my face a few days ago that I was a liar and sick. They don't even know who or know the who. They have no connection to the person but still scream about how I'm a filthy liar. I need third party input. Why am I being called names and a liar for finally not hiding anymore? I understand why my blood doesn't want to believe it because they know both of us. My life was threatened and I believed it until hiding the secret was killing me. It's been 13 years since the first one and 7 since the second.

2xjs5d,"I'm mean, he breaks stuff I play dirty. I admit that. I say things that I know will hurt my husband when we fight. He then breaks my stuff and threatens me with more. 

I tested positive for HPV the other day after 2.5 years with my partner. I have not cheated but he has a promiscuous past and gave me chlamydia when we first got together. I had never had an STD before and always played it safe, but the first time we slept together we were messing around and he was photographing me from behind and slid in without a condom before I knew what was going on. I digress. 

Anyway, I got diagnosed with high-risk HPV the other day and I fear he might have cheated on me. I got VERY upset because I had to have a biopsy and I don't trust him and I said ""you take after your dad with the cheating"" because his dad--an alcoholic-- cheated on his mom. And I started going off and saying bad things about his dad  and he got mad and body slammed himself into my Japanese screen divider and then threw it on the floor and destroyed it. He then took a picture frame I had and threw it against the wall to try and break it and it left a dent in the wall. I filmed him and he tried to wrestle the phone out of my hands. This was mere hours after my biopsy and I was not supposed to even vacuum much less engage in physical activity and he knew this. Anyway, he managed to severely damage my iphone before i got it back but it still works and I wasn't about to let go. 

He now says that if I bring up his dad again in a fight he will break something of mine every time. I know I can be cruel, but now I am scared he might also be violent toward me if I blow my top and become verbally abusive. I don't want to be verbally abusive and want to stop and get help, but I am more scared in the immediate that I might get seriously physicaly hurt. 

I don't know what to do; I'm in serious pain from the biopsy i had today and scared all of my posesions are going to get destroyed every time we fight. Or worse that he will take the anger out on me.

11fbs1,"""Men cannot be raped."" I was raped (?) repeatedly from the age of 6 till I was 14 by a relative. Every night. for 8 years. I had neatly tucked away all thoughts/memories/feelings about it since then until last year when some feelings surfaced and I went to talk to it with a therapist. The therapist was a reputed psychologist who also works in my school's Psych dept. and trains Post docs and interns(?). 

When I told her I was raped, she told me that wasn't rape. She said men cannot be raped. It's only rape when men rape women. 

I was distraught then. This topic came up again last night when in my drunken stupor I confessed to my best friend. She yelled at me for trivializing real rape of women and girls by calling my experiences by the same word. 

It must be said that there is no doubts about the qualifications of my therapist. She is an experienced, renowned, caring individual.
My friend is a very caring and nice person. She is also very progressive, educated person.

1cd5uf,"My [19 m] girlfriend's [18 f] brother [18 m] hits her and her younger sisters. Background: I am a 19 year old, male, college student. My girlfriend and her brother will be next year, and we will all be attending the same local university, and living with our families due to money issues. I have been dating my girlfriend for 10 months now. For convenience, we will call my girlfriend Jane and her brother Dick. 

Before I dated Jane, I had a few classes with Dick. We got along decently. Recently, Dick has been very upset with me, going so far as lying to his mother about our relationship and lying to others about our relationships, notably that I'm ""using her for sex.""

While having a conversation tonight over text, Jane revealed that Dick has hit her multiple times in the past. I asked how hard he hit her, and she responded that ""typically he leaves bruises or draws blood."" When asked why Dick hits her, Jane said the reasons are ""simply getting in his way. Winning board games. Bothering him. Bumping into him on accident. Not being fast enough. Or simply just being with him at the wrong time.""

Jane's mother knows about this. She dismisses it as ""he's just a boy who needs to express himself."" 

Jane also said he hits ""not just me. My little sisters too. Only they try fighting him back. And then he beats them to a pulp."" I do not know their exact ages, but Jane's younger sisters are in 7th and 4th grade. Jane did not say what she defines as being ""beat to a pulp"", although I can only assume it's worse than bruising or drawing blood, as that's what Dick does to Jane.

Jane hasn't been hit recently, as she's been avoiding Dick ""He's hardly been in the same room as me for a month, so I haven't been injured for a while."" Jane's 7th grade sister was hit ""a few days ago."" 

My question is what can or should be done about this? It's my belief that actions like this, especially at this age, should be confronted with therapy. Jane has expressed the opinion that she doesn't want to do anything about this. She believes there's no action that will benefit her, and believes taking any action will cause more violence towards her. 

This is not my family. However, it's a serious issue that needs some sort of mediation. Their mother clearly doesn't believe it's a problem, making this harder for me. I need to know what I can do, and what is ""right"" for me to do given it isn't my family. 

Dick and Jane are both in high school. I believe talking to a guidance counselor would be an option before talking to cops. I don't know what the benefits or consequences of talking to one over the other would be. 

I've never dealt with a situation like this, but want to help. For the record, I have screen shots of all of the texts Jane sent me, and her number is included in those texts. It seemed like a good idea given the circumstances. 

**TL;DR: My girlfriend and her younger sisters are hit--bruises are left, blood is drawn. Their mother doesn't see a problem. I do. What can/should I do?**

Edit: Jane has answered what ""beat to a pulp"" means.

Now they first girl, ""lacy"", was a sweet young thing and played with my sibling and I because we were kids and hey kids play. Most do anyway. now one day lacy decides to ask my brother and i if we wanted to have sex. My brother smartly said no in revulsion but i was the young naive kid and had no idea what that was. I say yes and next thing i know i get a blowjob. (to any sick fuck asking what the hell im complaining about I WAS 5, i want to just skin alive any sick fuck who wont understand.) So this goes on for a few months and then she moves away. Then the next group of foster kids move in and i meet ""ashley"" i eventually get around to doing stuff with ashley and one day she tells me while im naked on top of her that this is what her and her boyfriend used to do. WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF SICK WORLD IS THIS WHERE EVERY ONE OF MY EARLY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS WERE MOLESTED??? i had a latency period after we moved when i was 7. I thought of cutting up lacy doom-esque style with a chainsaw for what she did to me, made me be, whatever. Those subsided and i bet i would've grown up right if i hadn't been homeless for a few years ages 8 to 11

Life has been a nightmare. dad did drugs, mom didnt really care, my most vivid childhood memory is being **so** hungry and not able to eat because of the Ritalin my parents forced me to take and the neighbor girl pestering me for ""fun"" while im trying to eat microwaved eggs i made myself. 

Sometimes i feel im just waiting for the sweet end.

Sometimes i feel i want to find a pedophile of my own and keep them locked in a basement and make them experience pain for years and years for the monsters they make that ruin us. No one would love him/her like i would. and i would love them soooooo much.

**convinced no one would reply tothis shit, signing off throwaway account and leavimg this here.**

Today i just want peace and a normal childhood again, where i never would've wanted sex until i was like 13 or something reasonable like that. yeah. Normalcy.


good wishes, off to drink now.

2ifbwc,"I'm relieved he's dead, but I still mourn. I moved 600 miles away to a different city to get away from my abusive ex boyfriend in August 2012. In December 2013, he died of a drug overdose. I didn't answer any of the calls I received that day (after reading a text that informed me of his death), knowing that our mutual friends probably only wanted to pick my brain and add to the ""drama"" for their own entertainment. At the time, all I could think about was how relieved I was to finally be able to go home and see my family without fear of being killed by this man. I felt bad about it. A human being had died young and I had a positive reaction to his death. I am not a hateful woman. However, he'd damaged me so badly in the four years we were together. Even though I moved so far away and assumed a normal life, I still have nightmares about times when he asked me how it felt to die as he choked me on my couch, or kicked me in the ribs and spit on me while I cried out for god or whatever could possibly save me. There were so many times that I cried out for someone to help, but he had locked the windows and doors and taken my phone. Remembering those times is still so, so sickening. It hurts me to my core and makes me feel worthless and ashamed. 
In the two years since I fled, I've moved on. I have a good job and a wonderful boyfriend and I love my life in my new city. I obviously didn't attend his funeral, but sometimes I wish that I would've been there to send him off...for closure for myself and for him. I'd loved him unlike anyone else despite what he'd done to me. On the other hand, I hate that I still think and dream about him. I'm just unable to completely erase four years of my life.

34jmff,"Accepting I do not have ""real"" parents to lean on So, I'm really struggling to deal with my acceptance of my childhood experiences. I'm struggling so much in fact that the thought of ending it all for myself came into my mind recently. So far just a thought, but it paints a picture of how painful this is. I wish that I could say I only experienced this type of abuse. But, luckily for me, I experienced the gambit. Both of my parents were involved in some form or fashion. My mother was the main perpetrator in the physical and sexual sense; however, my father was and has always been emotionally absent due to his mental illness. He neglected to even provide food on the table for my brother when somehow he was granted custody. My mother even neglected to give certain medical care to me. It would be traumatic for anyone to accept the things that I went through. But, currently, I'm overwhelmed by the fact that my parents are incapable of being ""real"" parents to me ever. I mean, how am I supposed to cope with that? I've always leaned toward true optimism, believing with so much passion that everyone is capable of so much goodness and there is always hope for people to change. But, now that I have answers to questions that I always had but was too afraid to ask, I'm unfortunately learning that not everyone sees the point in changing and some people truly are corrupt. It hits even closer to home because these people we are talking about are my biological parents. How do I go forward with this information? It's possible that both my parents may either a) become homeless, b) die very young because they don't care to take care of their physical body, or c) become suicidal yet again and die from that. It's a very real possibility that either of those scenarios could happen. And, if I stick with this life that I have been given, how am I supposed to cope with not having parents around for my future wedding, the birth of my children, and all of life's accomplishments? Even if they are still living and I know where they live, I don't want a relationship with either one until they can emotionally be a mom and a dad. It's too toxic for me otherwise. I want to end the cycle of abuse that is present in both sides of my family. Obviously, I don't want to end my life, but I just wish I didn't have to deal with this. I feel that no one really understands what I am facing. I desperately want to thrive and feel the joy of all life has to offer, but how do I achieve that when this is the hand I was dealt?

Basically I need to figure out how to know if I can tell someone about what happened to me.

It feels like because I'm a male people assume that I *liked or wanted* to be treated like that (I only told some of my make friend about three first time-where I was picked on by older girls relentlessly), and thus nobody is actually willing to listen to my full story.

If she starts in on how some other relative is horrible and starts gossiping, you can say, ""Yeah! I really love the summer. There is nothing like going to the beach. I am glad you agree.... etc.""

Just refuse to engage. Make the conversation what you want it to be. If she won't go along with it, walk away. Talk to somebody else.

12ymt1,"Wife's abuser dying (xpost from r/advice) Hi everybody, 

My wife was sexually abused by her grandfather as a young girl.  Her entire extended family has metal heath issues, though she's lucky enough to have a loving, mostly harmless-crazy immidiate family.  For  various reasons (future inheritance, living two blocks away) her parents are still highly involved in the lives of her grandparents.

Anyway, the old bastard is dying.  I've resigned myself to wishing him ill from afar, knowing the truth (I'm lucky that I have a reputation for morbid humor and double entendres, because I've said some pretty harsh things).  I'm worried about my wife.  Shes notdepressed anymore, and hasn't been seeing a therapist since we moved away from the one that she first worked through these issues with, but I know the trauma still impacts her life.


I don't expect that she should confront her grandfather before he dies, but once he does die it limits the actions she can take in the future.  So do I make sure she finds a therapist before it happens?  What are the resources she might need once he dies?

193rbp,"Surviving I felt the immense urge to post this today...I am a survivor of domestic violence. I lived by a quote my grandfather once said(before passing away). You can handle anything except physical violence). 
I lived by that for almost 10 years of an extremely psychological and emotionally abusive relationship. I don't think he did this with ill intent but I don't believe he knew what such a thing does to a person. 
I was able to overcome phobias like: driving, speaking on the phone, having self-esteem, and the mere thought of having FEELINGS. Please do not stay in a relationship where any of these factors are threatened. I have been away from my husband for over six months...he has done NOTHING to see if his children are clothed or fed. I am about to lose my job because the vehicle I am driving has a broken taillight and am afraid to have anything negative on my record....(I can't afford to have it fixed at the moment). Despite the frustration of being diagnosed with plantar fasciitis... Due to being on my feet for over 14hrs a day...can't afford to quit my quit my job. 
Despite all of these frustrations....I know that I did what was best for my children(two of which are autistic). He has ways to offer financial help and he hasn't! Despite all of the things he said he'd do. It took until now to feel I was finally strong enough to stand up to him...may not have the money to get all of the paper work on order now, I know I will. 
Please! No matter how afraid he or she makes you feel, there is always hope! I get to finally give my children the mother they deserve. I can finally stop living my life for him and be the mother my children deserve! Even if you don't have children....is that the life you want for them? 
It is difficult but I realized...I will not cry to give up but to keep on going!
I didn't want to believe how bad it was until I left...until I finally decided to fight back....that did not erase whoever the sight of my children having to witness me finally fighting back...a black eye I had to cover up. 
It killed me to know they have not once broken down about missing their dad. After all of this time it is an affirmation, I made the right choice. I only hope that this post will encourage someone to do the same.

p2qvy,"I've been trying to get over this, but I don't know what to do next. I was molested by my elderly neighbor when I was a kid, from about 6-9 or older, I don't remember how old I was when it stopped, but before 12, because he died then. 

I didn't think about it for a long time, I didn't know it was abuse. I remembered it, I knew I happened, but it didn't understand what had happened, it was normal to me, eventually I realized that what I'd been through wasn't normal and it was abuse. I told a friend, went through a serious depression for a long time, and more recently became very obsessed with my abuser. I never got the chance for justice, and all I've thought of for a while is why. Why did he do this to me? Why couldn't he stop? I just felt the need to know everything about him, so I could make sense of what happened somehow. I got a little crazy there for a while. I went to the apartment where I was abused a few times... and spoke to his wife. I didn't tell her about the abuse, I just.. asked about him. I wanted information, so I gave myself these missions and snooped around. It just made me miserable, no amount of information was enough, it was all a big disappointment because I wanted an explanation for why I was abused and I couldn't get that.

I'm in therapy now, have been for over a year, my therapist keeps talking about how much progress I've made, and I guess I kind of see it, it isn't a lot and I still get bad from time to time thinking about my abuser, so I feel like I'm stuck in this stupid loop of wanting to know everything about my abuser's life and being numb to everything and not thinking about it.

I've been pretty ok lately, not thinking about it at all, even though this time of year is bad for me. Point is, now I'm thinking about him again. It's just so frustrating, because I feel like I've come so far from where I was when I was obsessed with him, but then I go back to it, like wanting the information and reasons and wanting to stop at nothing to have it. 

I want to be ok with it. I want to move on and not be controlled by what happened but I don't know what I'm supposed to do. My family doesn't give a shit, if I ever try to talk about the abuse I get yelled at, because no one wants to deal with my feelings about it. 

So what's the next step? I can't talk to my abuser and I can't send him to jail. How can I make the abuse less significant thing in my life? Every time that I stop thinking about it for a while it's nice, then one day I realize that I haven't thought about it and I'm like, cool, but then the cycle starts again and I get really depressed and suicidal because I'm tired of him being in my thoughts.

2k2aik,Domestic abuse is not about alcohol or anger. It is time that as a society we stopped saying that domestic violence happens as a result of alcohol problems or is an anger management issue. Let's be clear - Alcohol is an excuse for violence but not the reason. Anger is a tactic used to control and gain power but it is not the problem. The problem is one of abuse. Someone can stop drinking ... and take ten minutes outside when they get too angry but would still continue to physically and verbally abuse their victim. We need to be looking at long term offender rehabilitation as a real outcome for guilty verdicts in these crimes as opposed to mandatory AA meetings or Anger Management courses. ,abuse,"['domestic', 'abuse', 'alcohol', 'anger', 'time', 'society', 'stopped', 'saying', 'domestic', 'violence', 'happens', 'result', 'alcohol', 'problems', 'anger', 'management', 'issue', 'let', 'clear', 'alcohol', 'excuse', 'violence', 'reason', 'anger', 'tactic', 'used', 'control', 'gain', 'power', 'problem', 'problem', 'one', 'abuse', 'someone', 'stop', 'drinking', 'take', 'ten', 'minutes', 'outside', 'get', 'angry', 'would', 'still', 'continue', 'physically', 'verbally', 'abuse', 'victim', 'need', 'looking', 'long', 'term', 'offender', 'rehabilitation', 'real', 'outcome', 'guilty', 'verdicts', 'crimes', 'opposed', 'mandatory', 'aa', 'meetings', 'anger', 'management', 'courses']"

Since then Ive struggled to lead a meaningful life. I have no family(obviously), no real relationships, or anything I would call a future. I feel ""empty"". And my life is empty. I cant get close to anyone. And they dont want to get close to me. Cant blame em.

So today Im going to try something different.

1x2n4p,"Repressed memories? Hi all, first post on this forum. I'm not sure if I need a trigger warning or anything in the title, so please, let me know if I do.

My stepfather was abusive when I was growing up. He emotionally and physically abused my mum, and sexually abused my sister for the whole time he was around, probably about 10 years. 

Towards me, I don't really remember him being that abusive. He certainly hit me more than a few times, sometimes quite hard, but he didn't beat the shit out of me or anything. Mostly it was emotional stuff.

Problem is, though, I actually can't remember most of my childhood. I was talking to my real dad, and he told me a story about an incident where my stepdad hit my mum, and apparently I absolutely lost my shit and tried to attack him (I was about 9 or 10). I can't remember this, at all. Not a single bit of it jogs any kind of memory for me. The incident has been corroborated by my mum and my sister.

So I guess I'm a little worried now. I'm the only one in my family who hasn't had years of therapy, and I wonder what else I've forgotten. I think I've turned out okay, mostly what I notice is I get extremely emotional when women are hurt. I can't even watch movies if they have women being harmed in some way.

16qumy,"Don't know where else to put it, but I lost control today and made a horrible mistake. I don't know what to do now. I was the abuser. In the middle of an argument, she started walking out of the room while I was talking.  I rushed to the door trying to get her to stay and finish talking and she walked into me trying to get out of the way.  Instead of doing the smart and right thing and just moving out of the way, I put my hands on the side of each of her arms near the shoulder trying to get her to stay.  When she continued to push, I pushed back and she fell back on the bed.  I felt horrible the second I did it and she looked terrified.  She left to the front door but stayed and talked somewhat while I kept a far distance.  I've apologized as much as I could, but I know the damage is done.  I don't expect forgiveness.  Everything I could think to say just sounded cliche.  I've done a horrible thing, and there's no justification for it.  I know this is usually for the victims to get help and support and that's how it should be.  I just want to know how to get better, what to do so that something like this never happens again.  I don't know what I'm supposed to do at this point.  I never thought I would do something like this, and that makes me question a lot.  Edit: I always read that it's not a one-time thing.

2vu5um,"My Mother's been in an abusive relationship for about 30 years now. She finally turned him in. Arrest warrent was issued but he is out of state. I am just wondering what to expect.. Can anyone give me some insight as to what we can expect (from a legal standpoint) in the coming weeks/months? My mother has been in an abusive relationship for almost 30 years now, just recently she was admitted into the hospital with really bad head wounds, it looked like she had been beaten but she didn't remember anything that had happened. 

Her boyfriend insists that she fell off the bed and hit hear head, and when it happened instead of calling 911 or something he send me and my mothers sisters pictures of her soaked in blood. Then he called me stressing his innocence. 

The police were called and my mother said she had no idea what had happened. A few weeks ago she found a gun under the bed covered in blood and hair and she now believes she was pistol whipped. She called the police and they issued a warrent for his arrest. He is currently out of state, she has a protection order against him but he still dosen't know. 

This man threatened to kill me, to kill her even to murder my children but we have no real proof because none of those conversations were recorded. 

I am worried about a few things. 1. Most of the case against him is circumstansial. She has been abused by him for years and years this is not the first time he pistol whipped her, he once beat her leggs with the but of a gun so badly she couldn't walk for days. 
But again, there is no proof. She also made the mistake of attempting to clean the gun to protect him until I convinced her to call the police so who knows what fingerprints are on it if any. 
There was blood and hair still on it and the bloody rag she used to whipe it down but I am worried that it will come down to her word against his. 

The man is dangerous, this is not his first DV case his first wife had him arrested, he was also involved in a standoff with the police back in the late 80's and he was even busted with multiple pounds of Marijuana, Cocaine and LSD but he never did any time for that, in fact he ended up as a police officer. 

What will happen after he is arrested? He takes pride in the fact that he's never married my mother so he can hold their house and everything over her head he constantly threatens to throw her out and leave her with nothing even though she pays the entire morgage on the house and all utilities etc. 

I'm just overwhelmed, worried and no sure what to expect. 

If anyone can give me some idea of what happens to the accused in this kind of situation when there is no real hard evidence I would be most greatful., ",abuse,"['mother', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'years', 'finally', 'turned', 'arrest', 'warrent', 'issued', 'state', 'wondering', 'expect', 'anyone', 'give', 'insight', 'expect', 'legal', 'standpoint', 'coming', 'weeks', 'months', 'mother', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'almost', 'years', 'recently', 'admitted', 'hospital', 'really', 'bad', 'head', 'wounds', 'looked', 'like', 'beaten', 'remember', 'anything', 'happened', 'boyfriend', 'insists', 'fell', 'bed', 'hit', 'hear', 'head', 'happened', 'instead', 'calling', 'something', 'send', 'mothers', 'sisters', 'pictures', 'soaked', 'blood', 'called', 'stressing', 'innocence', 'police', 'called', 'mother', 'said', 'idea', 'happened', 'weeks', 'ago', 'found', 'gun', 'bed', 'covered', 'blood', 'hair', 'believes', 'pistol', 'whipped', 'called', 'police', 'issued', 'warrent', 'arrest', 'currently', 'state', 'protection', 'order', 'still', 'dose', 'know', 'man', 'threatened', 'kill', 'kill', 'even', 'murder', 'children', 'real', 'proof', 'none', 'conversations', 'recorded', 'worried', 'things', 'case', 'circumstansial', 'abused', 'years', 'years', 'first', 'time', 'pistol', 'whipped', 'beat', 'leggs', 'gun', 'badly', 'could', 'walk', 'days', 'proof', 'also', 'made', 'mistake', 'attempting', 'clean', 'gun', 'protect', 'convinced', 'call', 'police', 'knows', 'fingerprints', 'blood', 'hair', 'still', 'bloody', 'rag', 'used', 'whipe', 'worried', 'come', 'word', 'man', 'dangerous', 'first', 'dv', 'case', 'first', 'wife', 'arrested', 'also', 'involved', 'standoff', 'police', 'back', 'late', 'even', 'busted', 'multiple', 'pounds', 'marijuana', 'cocaine', 'lsd', 'never', 'time', 'fact', 'ended', 'police', 'officer', 'happen', 'arrested', 'takes', 'pride', 'fact', 'never', 'married', 'mother', 'hold', 'house', 'everything', 'head', 'constantly', 'threatens', 'throw', 'leave', 'nothing', 'even', 'though', 'pays', 'entire', 'morgage', 'house', 'utilities', 'etc', 'overwhelmed', 'worried', 'sure', 'expect', 'anyone', 'give', 'idea', 'happens', 'accused', 'kind', 'situation', 'real', 'hard', 'evidence', 'would', 'greatful']"
24qz8c,"I learned that my brother and sister have similar dreams, due to our abusive father. x-post from /r/dreams

My dream history is extensive. I started having night terrors as a child (I'm now 44F) and still have them. They always take place in the bed in which I am actually sleeping and seem almost paranormal sometimes. The threat/big bad represents my dad, but in my dreams he comes in many forms. In most, I become lucid and can wake myself up. I used to have to scream (find my voice so to speak), and now I say my SO's name. This has been working for over a year, but last month I couldn't even recognize I was dreaming and full on bloody screamed - in that one, there was something cutting my sheets all around me and trying to get to me. It is very hard to go back to sleep and not slip back into the dream. I should note that I have a very active dream life, I even have natural disaster dreams where I actually die.

My sister's stress dreams are more about her adult life (married 35). She has 3 children and she has lots of dreams about locking all of the doors, checking all of the windows and such, in her house and needing to make sure everyone is safe. She believes that the big unknown bad represents our dad. She wakes up in a panic, but knows it's a dream.

My brother's dreams are about protecting our sister from our dad. Dad is dead (about 5 years now) and brother is 26. He actually had a dream where my brother stepped in front of my sister as our dad was approaching and he told our dad to fuck off. He put himself between the bad and my sister to protect her. He's the youngest and feels guilt about not being able to do anything about it when we were all younger. He also didn't learn about the abuse from us until after our dad passed.

I didn't know until this weekend that my brother and sister also have dreams about our dad. My brother's are the most specific. I've never actually had a dream where our dad was there - he is always represented as some big evil threat coming at me in my bed.

Anyway, I wanted to share and see if anyone else had similar experiences with family members. I find it fascinating.

**TL,DR: My father abused me and my sister but not our brother. We all have disturbing dreams about our dad to varying degrees, but with similar themes of fear, safety and protection.**

tpvpd,"Re-developing a problem? I just found this subreddit a couple minutes ago, and I'm really liking the support community I see here, so I thought this would be a good place to start my story. I just got into a ridiculous and utterly pointless argument with my girlfriend, and our fights have been getting worse. We've been together for five months now, and we both want to take our relationship seriously. That being said, I want to kick this problem as soon as I can, because my relationship with her means a lot to me. I would appreciate any advice or help you guys have to offer.


Trying to keep this at least relatively short, I'm 21 years old, now a senior in college. I've taken to the ol' college drinking thing pretty er...well I guess. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8, and had issues with authority throughout my school life. I had an unfortunate reputation to throw objects, hit things, hit myself, and scream until my voice wouldn't work anymore. Whenever I felt like I was being controlled by another person, thing, or even some abstract idea, I reacted violently. I felt threatened by anyone that gave me a vibe they were trying to control or manipulate me in any way. Episodes eventually became less common with age, and in time it seemed like the issue went away.


I mellowed out quite a bit in college. I like to attribute this to being satisfied with my social life that happens to include cannabis and alcohol use, which has helped me cope with my feelings to the point where I didn't even remember having a serious issue. But very recently episodes have started occurring again, seemingly out of no where. They typically start with arguments with my girlfriend, and escalate to me throwing or hitting things like I did when I was like...14 - or even 8 for that matter. I feel like I'm losing control of myself, ironically, when I'm reacting to feeling like someone is trying to take control of me.

2942ux,"Anger at every turn I am angry. That is fact. Everything that I do, or happens to me, incites some sort of angry outburst or regression on my part. I don't even know where to start.

A few weeks ago, I checked myself into the hospital out of work because I was having a breakdown. I was so angry, irrationally so, at what was happening to me at work that I just could not take it, so I called it in to my doctor and they suggested psychiatric help at the hospital. After a few day stay, I was prescribed treatment sessions with a doctor (psychiatrist). A little background before we go into this however...

I have lived in an angry household since I was born. My twin brother and I were born out of wedlock, and my parents entered into a cataclysmic 15 year union that was at best bearable and at worst abusive. My dad has never spoken praise of me, nor has he ever tried to understand me on an emotional or intellectual level. I was always on the upper end of my classes, starting in grade school with higher ed learning, and has transitioned all the way to college. Now, my dad is overtly angry. Everyday, no fail, I am called a name that wouldn't be allowed on radio or anywhere decent. My mom, on the other hand, is a passive aggressive nightmare who has emotional outbursts at anything outside of her control (never anger, almost purely crying/panic). Neither parent has ever been emotionally there for me. I remember the time when I lost faith in my dad as a parent. I am 24 now, but when I was 16 I had my first girlfriend. On my 16th I had a birthday, which had unlimited minutes after 9 pm. My dad suggested only using phone after 9 (which is not possible.) I was sitting in my room, about 7:30 pm, talking on the phone with the girlfriend. My dad storms in, points at his watch, and proceeds to grab the phone and break it on the wall. I'm not going to lie, I have adopted traits from both of my parents in regards to how I handle anger. I am passive until the moment of explosion, and then I destroy everything that is within grasp. I have done it multiple times, and enter into a sort of haze where I'm the bull and all I see is red. I fought my dad and my twin brother that night, causing kidney damage to my dad and gave my brother a bloody nose and black eye. This happens as if it beyond my control. It hurts me to know the Hyde is on the inside, waiting to snap. My mom doesn't help, because she jumps around from lifestyle to lifestyle, and as my psychiatrist said, she probably has mental issues of her own. I cpuld go into it, but just thinking anymore about my parents wants me to rip my hair out. Back to now. 


I finally decided to find help. I am talking to a great psychiatrist, but it almost seems too little too late. I can only afford once a month with him, but he is amazing. He gets me, which has never happened before with another person. He recommended the book Siddhartha, by Herman Hesse, and it was spot on. I wish I could see him more, because all of my other experiences with any different psychologist/therapist/psychiatrist ends in my unending anger. For whatever reason, I automatically get heated and frustrated when people downgrade my intellectual value. It's irrational, but it affects me regularly. I can't even sit in a college classroom without getting upset at every inane comment or stupid blunder by the other students. I can't even have dialogue, because I instantly get defensive on the outset, no matter what. It is debilitating.

The only time in my life I ever found solace in others was when I worked at a national after school program for kids. Kids are honest, almost always bluntly so, and for whatever reason it felt refreshing. Those little people taught me more about my self and the human condition than anything. I quit 2 weeks ago.

Other adults infuriate me. My anger blinds me so much when I have to deal with my peers and elders, that I am a shut in now. I barely leave my house. I can't sleep, and have to usually be high as all hell to go to sleep (marijuana). Tonight, since I am broke, UI have downed a 6 pack in a little under 10 minutes. I have no idea where to go from here. I have never hurt anyone besides the one scuffle with my dad, but I am scared as all hell that one day I will hurt someone if it goes unchecked.

I get super anxious about going. Fortunately the counsellor had to cancel last minute, but not before I'd wasted the previous day worrying about it.

1trzoq,"Need Financial Assistance to Leave him Hello, I need some advice or links to resources that will help me. I'm currently in a very abusive relationship with a man (if you can call him that) and I need to get out. I honestly can't believe this is even happening to me. My parents are abusive drug addicts, and I moved out when I was 17, and promised myself I would never have to deal with that again.

When I first started dating him, he was sweet and nice. Then he moved in with me and a few months later I lost my job. Now he is controlling and abusive. He had raped and hit me on multiple occasions. He won't let me leave by myself, I have to sneak out when he is gone. I am afraid to report to the police because I don't have the finances to live on my own, and I don't have money for a lawsuit or lawyer. I don't want to end up homeless in the middle of winter.

I have a part time job now, but I don't make enough to pay rent/utilities or even to buy food. I have filled out forms for food stamps, hopefully they are approved soon. I don't qualify for unemployment due to health issues.

I can't move in with my parents I don't want to go from a bad situation into another one. Right now I need either a full time job or some sort of assistance until I get a job.

I live in an expensive part of the country. My current yearly expenses are about $15,000 and I have the bare minimum, no car, no cable, etc. I am currently making roughly $500 a month.

2eq5ok,"Working on it, but intense feelings of guilt because it was literally all my fault. 10 years ago my wife divorced me after almost 10 years of marriage. She fell in love with someone else.

For the entirety of our marriage, she subjected me to sexual and psychological abuse. The whole time, I thought that I was the abuser. It wasn't until five years after the divorce, five years ago, that I realized that I had been the one to be abused, and she had exploited my fears and feelings of being an abuser to control me. 

I assumed I was the abuser because I was a man. Men were never the abused; they were always the abusers. That's how I thought.

Yet ... I willingly stayed that whole 10 years. I could have left. There were so many red flags: I tried getting help for my abusiveness so many times, but no therapists could ever help me BECAUSE I WAS NOT AN ABUSER. I tried reading books about how to forgive myself, but THERE WAS NOTHING TO FORGIVE. But still I stayed and I took it and continually thanked her for staying with me, a lowly, wretched abuser.

I could have left at any time.

32ef89,"The ways that I still suffer from my sexual abuse surprises me. I'm 28, and I finally had sex for the first time. It was great, but I'm finding vestiges from my sexual abuse in my thinking.

I was molested once at 6 by a family friend, then twice around 9 by a different family friend. I became very withdrawn and gained weight due to a desire to stay safe in my house instead of out playing. I think I also gained weight in hopes that it would protect me from predators. Since I've gotten older, and especially with this first p-in-v sex experience, I've noticed that sex is highly tied to my self-worth. If a man likes me and wants a relationship, then we'll have sex. Even now, I cannot seem to get it through my head that plenty of people have sex without emotional attachment, but I believe that my abuse has connected these things for me. I hate, hate, hate my body and myself, so I can't imagine a guy wanting me physically without also wanting me emotionally. This isn't and hasn't happened, though, so it's a mindset I'd like to change so that I can give myself freedom. I've also found that I like dominance and kink, but that I have no problem with, as it's tied to my need to feel protected, safe, and at the hands of someone I can trust. I see a therapist, although I honestly need a better one that I can't afford right now, and I'm generally too uncomfortable to talk about these things with other people. I know I need to talk through the abuse, because it has affected me far more than I gave it credit for as a kid, but I am very private, and it's very hard to discuss. It fascinates and scares me that these things are connected, and I think it's good to figure some of this out now before a relationship than in the thick of one.

2c3occ,"How to date as a male abuse survivor, and how to deal with it in general I guess. I was physically and emotionally abused by my father from the age of about 6 to about 15, at which point it became less frequent and I had more agency as a teenager. Usually, he would yell at me, slap me in the face really hard, kick me, and hit my head against the floor when he got angry, which was probably once every few months. Other things he's done include breaking a plastic box over my head, hitting me with a belt, punching me in the stomach and knocking the wind out of me, and making me get naked and take a cold shower in front of him. There are way more things to mention.

The verbal stuff was the worst. He would yell at me and berate me for hours, and say all kinds of mean sarcastic things, and really put me down. Sometimes he yelled at me or hit me in public. There was no way to get out of it until he decided to stop. He always treated me like a bad kid, even though I didn't get into trouble much and had pretty good grades. I was the leader of a couple major extra-curricular groups in school, and just graduated college with two engineering degrees in four years. I got a pretty good job out of college and just moved away from my parents about a month ago. I'm 22 right now.

It really sucks not having a loving and supportive family. I don't know if I'll talk to them or see them much anymore. I've also never had a girlfriend or had sex with anyone. I'm decently socially normal and can makes jokes if I'm in a good mood, and some female friends have said that they find me hot, but I don't know how true it is and I'm really worried. There have been some threads here where girls talk about their boyfriends holding them and comforting them while they share stories of abuse, and I don't know if a girl would do that for me or find a man who needed that attractive, even though she might be able to empathize. People say over and over that girls find confident guys with healthy self-esteem attractive, and I've had so much confidence and self-esteem taken from me. In any relationship, I'll have this huge stigmatizing emotional bomb to drop about my past abuse and family issues, in addition to not having dated anybody yet at this age. I don't even really know what confidence is. I stand up for myself and am resilient and hardworking, but I'm also pretty insecure and worried and it shows sometimes. Sometimes I'll be really depressed around friends or coworkers. A few times I've started crying in public, like at a train station or something.

So basically any advice would be appreciated. There's the family you're born with and the family you choose, and it doesn't seem like either is going to work out for me. A life without love isn't really worth it.

3357e5,"How to encourage a 20 yr old woman with PTSD to seek help ? I have a friend, who I know online-only, who was raped by her father from ages 5-10. fortunately he was busted and is rotting in prison. I met this friend in an online chatroom about depression, she was 17, where she confided the abuse to me (I was acting in capacity as an empathic ""listener"" ), she was probably comfortable doing this thinking she'd never talk to me again.

we ended up adding each other on messenger and I continued to offer emotional support. She didn't talk about the abuse very often after that (for obvious reasons ), but would confide that she was depressed, suicidal, self-injuring, etc. And I would try to offer encouragement.

She has clear symptoms of PTSD: hyperarousal, insomnia, anxiety, certain triggers, etc. I have suggested therapy a few times, and even offered to pay for it. she's not ready yet. and I backed off. 

I did some reading about PTSD and found that one of the few effective, non-pharmaceutical treatments is exposure therapy, where you slowly desensitize yourself to the trauma so that it can no longer haunt you. It made me wonder if there was any way I could convince her to go to therapy and hopefully get help from these debilitating symptoms ? I can only imagine how miserable it would be to not be able to sleep at night, every night. not even counting the haunting memories of child sex abuse.

2oz7hu,"Both of us are abusive but he's the only one who got arrested. I never wanted this. My boyfriend (27) and I (27) have been in a relationship for almost two years. He came from a seven year relationship where I heard both sides of the story: they hurt each other. I came from a relationship where basically the same thing happened. Needless to say the cycle continued and we have terrible fights anywhere from once a months to once every two months. We both come away from those fights with bruises and hurt feelings. The next day we begin a healing process but all it takes is some added stress at work or something and we're right back to killing each other. 

  I've been wanting to get some counseling with him involved but we just done have the money or the time. Last night he decided to drink. A lot. I was sober but for some reason just so angry about every stupid thing. He kept making a show of walking off and coming back and yelling. I yelled back. Then I left for an hour or so to cool off and when I can back my doors were locked. I banged on the door until he opened and when he did I punched him as hard as I could. Then he proceeded to beat the everliving crap out of me. I managed to get out and run to a neighbor's house after I hit in in the head with a bottle. The neighbor called the cops and now he's in jail with no way of getting in touch with me while I try to figure out how to fix this. 

I feel like a Stockholm victim or something but I know I'm to blame also. I'm just as abusive as he is. I'm just not as strong. In don't know what either of us will do. We kind of depend on each other for rent and bills and things, but also emotionally. We have strong feelings for each other and misplaced anger issues. We need help. I just don't know what to do. We are in the upper lower class and have full time jobs barely above minimum wage. It's not like we can afford the luxury of a therapist to help us. I'm rambling but I feel so heartbroken over all this.

2xoddh,"The Truth About Estrangement I was reading [this article](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/family-conflict/201503/big-decision-choosing-estrange-family) on estrangement when something clicked for me.  

Estrangement - cutting off contact and connection, severing a relationship with a family member - in the case of abusive or dysfunctional behaviors, *actually begins with the other person*.  That person has actively been alienating and disconnecting from the focus of their abusive or dysfunctional behavior; the enabling family has been supporting that alienation and disconnection.  *The only thing the abuser hasn't done is cut off contact, even while rending the relationship.*

The person going no-contact is taking the dynamic to its logical conclusion.  The relationship has already been forcibly dissolved, the connection between the parties severed.

Emotional estrangement occurs before 'physical' estrangement.  An abuser *has already estranged the abused*.

From [Merriam-Webster](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/estrange) are two definitions of ""estrange"" that I think encapsulate this concept:

&gt;to cause someone to be no longer friendly or close to another person or group

&gt;to cause someone to be no longer involved or connected with something

The relationship is estranged before contact is terminated.  The abuser is responsible for estrangement even if it is their victim who has ended contact.

1d37tf,"YSK: How to react when someone with anger problems lashes out It can be really hurtful and frustrating to understand when someone you love has anger issues. For me, I have been dealing wih my mom's irrational bouts of anger for almost my whole life. Ive been called names, screamed at, she has threatened to leave the house, etc. And it's taken me almost 23 years to figure out how to alleviate the ""episodes"" quickly and without much damage. Stay calm or quiet. Really. Now I'm sure this wont work with everyone, but it has for me.
It's a natural reaction to get angry yourself, or upset.  But adding emotion to the scene is like adding fuel to the fire. So leave the room, stay quiet, or calmly explain why her actions are hurting you. Think of it this way: if your angry friend/family member were screaming their head off at a metal concert, No one would notice, because they're probably acting nuts too. But if they screamed or acted angry in a quiet library, everyone will notice, and you can bet they'd be embarrassed. By you stayih calm, you are giving the irrationally angry person the opportunity to see how ridiculous and inappropriate they look. They see how they appear to others and how their hurtful words, when echoing in a quiet room, sound, well, mean. Every time I implement this strategy with my mom, I get an apology soon after. 

TL;DR- don't get angry or upset with people who are acting like crazed, angry maniacs.

Hello, I posted here a while ago but deleted my thread eventually for privacy. I went through what people have called sexual abuse which happened when I was younger twice. I often wonder if the fact that a victim was not forced or did not see the abuse as bad at the time changes the negative effects of the abuse, or if the negative after effects in such circumstances would be as a result of realizing that society sees these things as very bad, or if there is a purely scientific reason behind the damaging effects of the abuse, which would occur even without any knowledge of the ""badness"" of abuse, like maybe how it effects the brain regardless. As I know there is much research indicating it changes the development of the brain, but I'm not sure if this could be due to the force/lack of consent which is common in abuse. As at the time I almost never saw it as inappropriate or bad, so it feels sometimes like was it that bad that it happened? I've had a lot of trouble with depression and anxiety since I was a kid, but I've always felt like that was a result of being constantly lonely.

It's my intention to make sure that the same effort goes into making their online presence just as safe.

My thought is that the best way I can contribute is by educating both the visitors as well as the staff on how to secure their online identity. The people who come here for protection are already traumatized and might not be thinking about how easy it is for a dangerous spouse to monitor their activities through Social Networking sites and mobile devices so I want to evaluate what sort of security measures are already in place and make recommendations. Also provide awareness training to the staff as the shelter has a Facebook page.

I see this as a critical area of security and is not something to be taken lightly so I want to make sure that I can communicate properly and give good useful information that will not inadvertently inflame a potentially violent situation.

But when I talk to him about our problems or about how I feel, he'll say that I'm doing the same thing to him. When I say he doesn't respect me, he turns around and says our fights are because I don't respect his opinion and do whatever the hell I want. When I tell him about the sleepless nights I have after he says or does something mean, or withdraws emotionally, he'll tell me the reason he was mean or withdrew was because I was mean or sarcastic in the first place. He says he's had sleepless nights too, and it upsets him when I withdraw into the office and play computer games (which I mostly do when he's getting drunk in the living room, because he's even meaner when he's drunk... but then he would probably say I'm too emotional and mean when I'm drunk too). 

How can I tell if he's emotionally abusive or if I'm the one who is emotionally abusive and he's just responding? 

This is a big deal, because if it's him, I need to leave. If it's me, I need to get therapy and apologize.

Little background into me and my life - grew up in the suburbs of London, my parents split up when I was 10. As a result of this, I subsequently became very withdrawn and insecure about who I was. I have always moved and have never felt settled any where, or that I belong/deserve to be nice to myself. 
All this has stemmed from my parents divorced, and have 3 siblings to content with. I was always considered the 'good' child by my mother as she usually had to worry About me.  The older I have got (I'll be 29 next week) the most I've come to realise that I'd been (and probably still am) emotionally and psychologically abused by my mother (and to a degree, my father).  Now I've had various amounts of counselling, hypnotherapy and medication over the years to help, and have had to limit the time I spend with either of my parents just as I've discovered they are trigger points for my anxiety and panic attacks. Does anyone have any stories or advice that might be of use, so that I can finally live my life as I want to, I.e without the stress, anxiety or panic that comes with my past?

19unf4,"Advice for a long distance friend in an abusive situation? A friend of mine in Scottland is about 21 and lives at home. He posted this on a forum today and I don't know if there is anything I can do or any advice I can give him.
This is what he wrote:

'All I ever hear in this house is constant fighting, screaming, shouting, arguing and crying. It happens every single day, and I don't know what to do about it. I was supposed to go to college today, but due to all the screaming I was scared to go downstairs incase someone tried to hurt me. Instead I just lay in bed, hiding under my covers trying to cover my ears with my pillow to block out the drama, which is what I always end up doing. I tried to help and put a stop to it a few days ago, but all I got was a punch straight to my face for my troubles. The worst part is probably the fact that when the drama finally stops, everyone acts like absolutely nothing happened and everything goes back to ""normal"".

I don't know why I am sharing this here. I guess I have nowhere else to turn. A friend of mine wanted me to go stay with him for a while, but his dad was against the idea. I have nowhere else to go. All of this is just making my head messed up, and as some of you may already know I'm not exactly emotionally stable. I'd be lying if I said dark thoughts having been entering my head again lately.

I don't know what to do. I have no other family or friends to stay with, and I can't focus on my work at college because of all this. I've had to put up with things like this my entire life, but it just seems to get worse and worse everyday. I have tried to take time off from college to try and get my head straight, but I'm pretty sure that the lecturers just think I'm bullshitting them, and I don't want to explain my circumstances to them as I don't trust my college at all. One of my lecturers always patronises me, telling me I don't study enough and I shouldn't be in her class because I clearly don't want to pass, and that isn't helping either.

w11t3,"My own, personal, Independence Day. I was going to mark this day with something more thought out, but time got away on me, so I've had to scale back my ideas, but I didn't want to let it pass without remark.

One year ago, I left her... by getting arrested. The moments of clarity when you realise that the police officers who thought you were a batterer still treated you better than she did. Realising that the cold cell with someone else's shit and blood on the walls felt safer than home.

Being a male victim of domestic violence in this country (New Zealand) is... unpleasant - police statistics show DV arrests are over 95% male, and I bet I'm not the only victim hiding in those numbers. There is nowhere to go. There is no help. The domestic violence agencies don't just ignore you, they actively deny your existence.

I'd actually turned up at the police station nine months before the final incident, both kids in tow, all of us crying. They pulled her in, and sent me and the kids home... then sent her home without even letting me know she'd been released. No charges, no help then, no follow up later... and I paid for that indiscretion for quite some time. The nerve of me, daring to try and bring in outsiders!

From a check-list where I scored 64 points:

""59-95: Seriously Abusive

Scores in this range indicate a seriously abusive relationship that can, under outside pressure, or with the sudden strain of a family emergency, move into the dangerously severe range. Serious injury is quite probable if it has not already occurred. Please consider getting help, even leaving.""

2q5kpj,"Fucking Uncle My circle died tonight (12/22).  He had been sick, Stage IV throat cancer that spread.  Thats not the part I'm mad about.  What pisses me AND the family off is that even though he had been battling cancer for about 3 years now, there were trust issues regarding his health. He did have cancer and he never stopped smoking.  While I can see letting someone who is on their last legs a little relief with something like that, he had a history with drugs.  

Several times he claimed to be clean but somehow always found himself in jail for drug related charges.  So theres where the trust issues came in.  He lived at home with parents still (at 53) but both of his parents were incapacitated themselves.  

His mother is wheel chaired bound and has been for about 7 years and his father is starting a battle with Alzheimer's and is in a elderly care facility at the time of this writing.  While he did help out when he could, he would also disappear for days on end too, WHILE FIGHTING CANCER!

So he dies tonight, not peacefully in his bed, not resting in a chair and quietly passes, his YOUNGER brother/sorta care giver comes home from work to find him sprawled out on the floor of his room unresponsive.  Door closed (not unusual) so his mother had no idea (losing hearing if he fell and made a commotion).

So after all the phone calls are made and whose going to help out with arrangements (his older brother/my dad and my family live 300 miles away) I have to tell my daughter (age 5) about why Christmas is being postponed.

The conversation goes like this(I used real names but won't here):
Me: Daughter, Christmas is going to have to wait this year.
Daughter: OK, why?
M: You remember Uncle XXXX?
D: *her face lights up* YEAH!
M: *After several attempts through tears* Uncle XXXX died tonight
D: Oh
M: Do you know what that means?
D: *starts crying* Yes, it means I can't see him anymore

2jcx8x,"My best friend is in trouble &amp; I need advice I'm going to make this as short &amp; concise as possible, but my beautiful best friend who I've known for 18 years is back with the man (Vin) who beat her senseless about a year ago. He was physically, emotionally &amp; sexually abusive towards her for the year they dated, he pretty much kept her prisoner in his house, I was lucky if I got a text back from her, getting to see her was almost impossible. She grew up poor, she's 21 now &amp; he's 39 &amp; has a lot of money &amp; spoils her with outrageous things when he feels like acting nice to her. 

We were supposed to see each other back in September, everything was almost back to normal again after she had first left. But I never heard from her that weekend, neither did her then boyfriend (Matt) who saw pictures of her at this other guy's house. Matt went there to drop off her stuff &amp; Vin shot at him. Their court date is in November. Matt told me this, I immediately panicked upon hearing she was back together with this psychopath. Texted her, she said she's never been happier in her life &amp; they were leaving for Puerto Rico in the morning. Went to the cops because I originally had thought he kidnapped her, especially after she went back to the police a few weeks prior because he was stalking her &amp; especially after all the texts she sent me didn't sound anything like her, although that's hard to judge &amp; won't stand up in court. I thought they would never come back, either skipping court or he was gonna kill her &amp; flee the country. (they actually did come back) Didn't hear from her again until a few days ago, she told me she ""needed my help right now"", I left my job to go pick her up from wherever she was, when I got 5 minutes down the road ""everything was fine &amp; she was just in a mood"". It didn't seem like she was texting me. The past few days we've been in touch because she wants to leave but her parents kicked her out after they found out she was back with this idiot. She only contacts me when he's sleeping. 

At first I thought she either lost her mind or was being manipulated or threatened by this guy. Either one is probably true. I just don't know what I can do, I filled out as many police reports as I could &amp; they were very cooperative with me but nothing really held up to the point where they could do anything. I just know for a fact that he's dangerous &amp; she's within his grips &amp; anything could be happening to her.

1moitk,"I think I need help When i was fifteen, my father started asking me wether i masturbated, if i put my fingers up my ass, if i liked it...leaving erotic stories about incest in the computer we shared, and even asking if i ever considered having ""something"" with him.

He tried to ""apologize"" (lamely) later, i sent him to hell again, and now, 11 years later, i think i might have ptsd, or that there is something seriously wrong.

I was on meds for the past 2 years, i completed my treatment (i would call it successful since i haven't had any anxiety attacks again) but i'm having episodes where i feel deep hatred for this son of a bitch. I fantasize about him being dead, about not having to see him again, and it makes me really conflicted. He had a crappy childhood, and was most likely abused/raped when he was a child. Sometimes (and this is the fucked up part) I get aroused by thinking about what he could have done if i had been weaker, if i hadn't stoped him. Sometimes i feel arousal by reading stories written by survivors of abuse (i read these stories when i'm feeling specially down because of the events).

So I heard about a week ago that he would be coming back into town this weekend to attend the event I'm helping to run. (He was in charge of it last year, so it's not really weird that he's coming) The thing is the last time I saw him in person was about a month before he ended our engagement. Several months after that he contacted me to apologize. But as I couldn't just forgive him on the spot I said that we had nothing to talk about and ended the conversation. We haven't spoken since.

This wouldn't be such a big deal if I hadn't found out that I can get triggered when I'm reminded of him and when we were together. I've only just started dealing with this, and am still uncomfortable thinking of myself as a ""victim"". I have a therapy appointment Friday afternoon--the day he gets here. So hopefully they'll be able to tell me how to handle it a little better. I've been imaging confronting him for a long time, but today I thought I saw him walking past me and freaked out.

Once home, I didn't calm down and after more of me yelling I strangled her neck for about 5 seconds.

Does anyone else have this problem (in any form)?

I still associate with my dad, my abuser (physical, sexual, verbal) who is hundreds of miles away. He's ""better"" with me now, but still can say inappropriate things, make me uncomfortable, and is still controlling. 
 
He pays me to come see him, including travel, and we need the money (I can't work a steady job due to PTSD, bipolar, anxiety and ADHD). So I go (alone) to my abuser's house for a week or more at a time to help him around the house and/or spend time with him and Mom. But every time I go, I come back more messed up. 

My councilor and psychiatrist have both said ""DON'T GO BACK!"", but I do because my dad's my financial safety net and I'm afraid he won't help if I don't go. My hubby did just got a 2nd job, so hopefully it will help. I'm also filing for disability, but it's a long process. And overall, I feel like I have no ""excuse"" to not go when Dad needs me, because my dad KNOWS I don't have a job. 

I also have it in my head that by going, it will help me grow to stand up to him, I can be a positive roll model for him, and eventually I can grow the courage to write to them about the abuse.

mddix,"I think someone locked me in a closet when I was young...or something dark.  Claustrophobia: I never really noticed or just was used to it. I live in NYC of all places and yet I have claustrophobia. I didn't even know I had it. I just thought it was normal.

I dealt with my problems unconsciously. I always take the back of the train where it is less crowded or wait for the next train which is usually less packed. I stayed away from crowded streets or 42nd street.

My boyfriend didn't know and he took me on a crowded car. I started freaking out internally...ie keepin my head down etc. When the crowds cleared I told him my problem because ....before I couldn't speak. He said I might have claustrophobia.

I brought it up with my therapist and he started playing out 42nd street and I started freaking out. He asked me why I was freaking out and I said because I was afraid I couldn't escape.

I'm going to therapy because I have a mother who basically tortured and manipulated me emotionally. I don't talk to her anymore. It's been 7 years basically. She justs stalks me via email and my blog. I've told her many times to stop. Either the google filters are working or she is finally listening to me.  

Good visual comparison: she is basically the mother in Mommie Dearest.

I have the strangest feeling I was locked in something when I was young. It came out of the blue this week. I'm starting to remember things that happened to me when I was younger that I blocked out. This has been going on since I found DBT (dialetical behavioral therapy) last December.

Maybe the ""locked in something dark"" is literal and figurative....I was trapped in a family that I couldn't get out of because I didn't have the tools.

18xu0g,"I really dont trust women (thanx to my past), what should I do to fix this? should I go see a damn therapist? and if I should what type of therapist focuses on this area?

anyways, there is a lot of reason for my behavior. I grew up with a really narcissist mother who was extremely perfectionist, she used to have a problem with everything I did in life; how I ate, how I handle life at school, limiting my friends, never letting me go out and see the world, threatening me how f***ed up the world is, etc. plus she used to abandon me on a daily basis when I was a child, always taken off and leaving me all over the damn places and you don't want to know the things I had to witness in those places I had to stay at; I would call her crying to comeback because I didn't like staying were I was and I wanted to go home. but she was such a sadist that when I did this she would respond to me with things like ""if you don't stop crying like a baby, I'm never gonna go get you!"" and all.

as I grew up into my pre teens and teens the situations with my two older brothers did not do anything but to fuel up my misogyny as the both got into relationships with chicks who were big time sluts. they even when as far as having kids with them and you don't want to know to how much more misery and insanity their actions lead to.

When I was twelve, I'm almost 21 now, I was (not sure if I can say this but) sexually abused by a boy about a year older than me in the same grade. What's worse is we rode the same bus and lived a few houses away from each other. I am not sure if this was abuse because it was repeated, or just sexual harassment but it was very real to me. He became my friend early in my 6th grade year, and soon after he started touching me. At first he would just force me to let him lay his head or hands on my lap saying that was ""what friends do"". And soon I began to dread seeing him. Every time I saw him on the bus or he forced me to hang out I felt dirty. He would put his hand up my shirt and feel my breasts (I was an early bloomer) or feel my butt in public when he could be sure no one was looking. If I told him no he would grab me by my wrist and all he would say was ""yes"". He made me see him almost everyday after school. I hated myself. Finally one day after school he tried to reach down the front of my pants. I nearly died right there. I felt like crying, that was once place I couldn't bear him to touch. I said ""no, please not there, anywhere but there"" and once again he grabbed my wrist pulled me against him so that I couldn't see his face, and whispered in my ear ""but I like it there"" I cried and I screamed at him (this was in front of our bus stop right behind my old house) and I said he couldn't. I don't know how but i managed to pull away, that's when he told me to go back to my ""boyfriend"" (my best guy friend at the time who he had isolated me from) but that I was ""dirty"" and it was ""my fault"" and who would want me after all I had let him do? I ran.

A month after and I had completely blocked out his name, I still can't remember. But I remember his hands, and parts of his face. Every time I think back to that old neighborhood I feel completely dirty all over again. I have only told my boyfriend (current) this story, I never told my mom (even though I know it was his fault, every time I try to tell her I feel so guilty and the words stick in my mouth).

So, I have no idea if this really belongs here, or if I just made a big deal out of a sexual harassment case. But I have yet to find any story like mine with a boy the same age committing the sexual abuse.

I was abused by a family friend when I was 12, I eventually talked about it when I was 16 and for the past three years I've been doing a decent job trying to put the abuse behind me. The news about Sandusky at Penn State has brought up a lot of bad memories and made me question just how over my past I am. I don't want to go to a therapist because I just want to move forward, but I know that there will probably be many more times in my life when there are high profile cases like this and I would like to know how others deal with this.

1f6we3,"I need help figuring this out. Was I abused? Its very hard for me to comprehend writing about this. It feels wrong to write this but I really need answers and I cannot confront the person in question. 


My parents divorced before I was 10 and for some reason this led to me to sleeping in the same bed as the male parent (sorry i can't write the word. I'm scared).

I was having a lot of bad dreams/experiences in my bedroom (I thought there was a ghost) and it led me to fear even walking in it! So I shared this bed until I was about 13-14. Firstly, I am ashamed of this already and ashamed of even writing this down. Sharing a bed for that long? Disgusting.


I would like to comment that I can't remember any signs of anything happening up until I was around 7-8. There was an instance where I walked out of my living room with the parent in question, and sharing a joke, the parent got a bit over-indulgent and grabbed my chest from behind and sort of shook me.

He apologised and I said, ""its okay, d__"". Saying it was okay may have been a mistake? But I didn't know really.

I know of another instance where the parent groped me while I was 'sleeping'. It was early morning so I was beginning to wake up and we were on holiday. I was about 13. He traced his finger around *an area* of my breast. I was half asleep so I tried to shrug this off and opened my eyes to see him staring at me. I can see this now and it makes me feel sick. I turned over and he did shortly after.

Between these memories (when i was sharing the bed), I would have dreams. But they weren't dreams. Its hard to explain but I would dream of being awake in the same room/time as I was sleeping and the things he would do were a little more than what I described. You know, full on bad things. These dreams always made me feel sick and i often still have them except they are actual dreams now and dont take place in the room i am sleeping in.

There's another memory too which involves me stroking our pet cat and wandering hands but it's too hard to describe.

Look guys, I need help. I love this parent to death but due to my depression, these memories/dreams or whatever are resurfacing. I have these awful sick dreams every week and I find it hard to sleep. I've only had one therapy session on this so far and they must have lost me in the system because i havent been called back.

I'd also like to point out that from around 11-15 i became increasingly isolated in the family home and would flinch at a family
members touch. I don't know why I did this.

Did these dreams actually happen in real time or were they some sick wet dream? I need help. Please.

2avps6,"Violence in friends' relationship, how react? I(female, midtwenties) have to friends in their mid twenties, lets call them A(male) and B(female). I met A some time ago and we did a couple of group activities together, had some beers, cooking, etc. we're not exactly close friends, but we can talk quite openly amongst each other - or so I thought. I also got to know his girlfriend, B, and we get along very well so by now I consider her a friend as well. They don't live together, but in different towns.

However, the last time we were going out (with a group of people), they had a fight about him being too touchy which ended with A hitting B in the face. He waited for this for them to be alone. She was very pissed and talked quite openly about it happening (it was the second time he hit her, the first time he told her it would never happen again), and I told her that if he MUST take consequences, and stop drinking/make a therapy, etc. and if he's not willing to she should stay the fuck away from him. We talked about it for some time, but although she is well aware that he has a problem, they are apparently still together.

When I heard the story, my immediate reaction was to not meet with A anymore, because I cannot consider him a friend anymore. Basically, the only way for ME to get trust in him again would be if he'd do a therapy. However, I got invited by A to an event that is hosted by B - and I'm at loss. What should I do? 

I'd like to go to the event, however, I don't want to meet with him. Would it be helpful if I told B I don't want to come unless A changes?

258ep2,"I'm so angry that he can get away with beating me. Venting/throwaway. My ex fiancee of four years became really violent in the last year we were together.
I had gone through so much loss, my mother died in 2011.
We moved to Florida and I got lost in my grief, I was listless and depressed. 
We moved back to the bay area and we got into a car accident, he was fine, both the bones in my left leg were broken.
We went out to breakfast with a co-worker of his and I became frightened that he had had a fling with her, and then the physical abuse really started.
I became delusional and had an emotional breakdown.
On Halloween he broke my finger, on Christmas Eve he beat me the worst he ever had, because I wanted to be held, I wanted affection.
He said, ""Don't you have any self respect?"" after he was done choking me, and I called the cops for the first time. 
He spent the night in jail, I didn't press charges, I freaked out and called his mother and she bailed him out the next day.
He wanted to try again, so we ""tried"" through January and February, but he was cruel and controlling.
In February, the day before Valentine's my cat died.
He blamed everything on me and broke up with me March 9th. I sought out therapy and have been attending regularly ever since.

He had always had a hard time communicating about emotions.
Granted, some of what he did in reflection was ""gaslighting"" in the last year we were together. I was delusional and codependent in ways I had never been before in a relationship.
I begged that we go to couple's therapy, to walk into the face of our pain and fix our relationship.
He ran away from it, broke up with me two months ago and now he's on this site, in an art thread, flirting with other women, drawing other women, hanging out with a group of individuals that know nothing of his cruelties.
He would lie to their faces anyway. 

I'm hurt and angry, I've been learning to be independent and cultivating self love, but the scars he left behind have traumatized me.
There's such a large part of me that wishes we could try again, because I really loved him and in the end, the relationship was so toxic that the both of us weren't the same people we had been. We weren't the people we wanted to be for ourselves or for each other.

And then I remember the abuse, the blame he cast on me and I become enraged. He made the choices to use physical violence, to be controlling and entitled.

11ffsa,"My grandfather has become more aggressive but not physically abusive  and I need some advice.  I am twenty years old and I live with my grandparents. The reason being is my grandmother raised me and I love her dearly, and she is easily shook up and I try my best to keep her calm as she is not in the best physical health and the emotional strain is not good for her. I don't currently have a job and I'm taking time off of school for my own personal reasons My grandfather has always been in my life as well he is a generally unhappy man. He worked hard until his body wore out on him and forced him to retire a year early. Because he had to retire early our income is not what it was or what it should have been when he retired. This happened over a year ago and for a while we were fine the cut backs were manageable and we got through it. In the last few months a few things have happened that have put us behind on money; being forced to move and having both our cars break down. This lead up to last week when we decided a loan needed to be taken out so we would be able to make it through to our next paycheck. This has upset him and he has been more aggressive lately. In the last week he has gone it to several fits; yelling at everyone, telling my grandmother she's an idiot and its a wonder she can breath, threatening to kick me out of the house, and that he was going to take our pets and leave them in to woods to die. He hasn't been physically abusive but my grandmother is a nervous wreck. We have been avoiding him as best we can but its not easy in our relatively small house. Since my grandmothers health could be at risk I don't want to sit back and do nothing but I don't know what I can actually do to improve our situation. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this it seemed the best place.

2wegna,"I don't know how to do this I've never really shared this with anyone before so i'm kinda nervous...  I know it isn't that bad but it's been dragging me down a lot recently and I feel like I need some advice.
My mom was very poor when she met my biological father, and he was fairly rich. Long story short, he just abandoned us as soon as I was born, leaving my mom with her abusive alcoholic brother. She had to draw the line when he started getting violent towards me, and went to live with a friend. She also had no way to take care of me as she had to work very hard so we wouldn't starve, and I ended up living with my grandparents (on my father's side) until she met my stepfather. This was a rather dark time for me, as my grandfather abused me sexually every time he got drunk (I only understood this was bad later on because I trusted him so much), and I went to a ""rich kid"" school, and that did NOT go well at all. I couldn't make any friends because everyone knew about my mother and I had no idea how to react to the meaner kids, so I just isolated myself. 
When I was about 7, my mom got married again and was stable enough financially so I could go live with her. I didn't like my stepfather at first. We fought a lot. He would kick me, drag me around by my ear, shout and one time he even handcuffed me outside for almost one hour. I had to change schools 5 times, and the only friend I managed to make eventually got bored and started treating me cruelly for fun. That is, until I entered high school. My relationship with my parents was going well and even thought I had to visit my grandparents frequently, the abuse stopped and I could pretend it never happened. I met three great friends, everything was going well. But even now, I don't feel alright. Can't trust men, crippling low self-esteem, constantly wondering if my friends dislike me, lack of motivation.. And every time I think I'm going to get better, I get worse. For the sake of keeping my friendships, I'm trying really hard but It's not really working and they're quickly getting tired of my shitty moods. Everything is falling apart and I honestly can't deal with it. I still like my grandpa and don't want to do anything against him, but I'm also afraid he'll do that to someone else. My mom has been putting a lot of pressure on me ever since she found out, and it's been affecting my social life very badly since my friends don't want anything to do with me when I'm not feeling great. I just don't know how to deal with this properly... Very sorry if this is confusing/badly written, it's very late over here.. but advice would be greatly appreciated.

11uaon,"Can Data help somehow with Domestic Violence? I'm serving on a Grand Jury at the moment.  In the Grand Jury we indict people for felonies (decide whether there is enough evidence to proceed with a trial).  Every day there are several (4 to 6) Domestic Violence cases.  The prosecutors ask the victims to testify before the Grand Jury, because they've found that if they don't get a testimony early in the process, they end up with no witnesses for the trial.

Less then 1 out of 10 testify at the Grand Jury.  Those that do are heart rending and sad.  The cases for those that don't are dismissed.

[Here is my story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/sb7q5/has_anyone_seenexperienced_a_glory_hole/c4cupnq?context=3), funnily enough it's from the last time the same question was asked, about a year ago.    It's probably full of triggers so you may want to be careful that I don't drag you down with me.

And that's the guts of the issue.  I know everyone says ""it's not your fault"" but I don't believe them.  I was never a normal kid. I was kind of a prodigy when I was very young and the thing is, although I was only 8 when the stuff in that story started to happen, *I knew what I was doing* and wanted it to happen.  That doesn't make me a victim, or a survivor.. it makes me a waste of space, who deserves whatever he gets.  And the guilt mixed with ambivalence, the fact I usually enjoyed what happened and even profited from it, means I can't move on.  I'm stuck and I don't know how to get away from this and I feel like my mind is racing with no way out.  

I guess I want someone to tell me again that it wasn't my fault.  I recognise that's selfish and I'm sorry.

1d0sck,"I've been contemplating seeing a counselor...and finding a way to get him help too. Any advice would be great... This is an extremely long story that I'll post in a comment. I'd really appreciate it if you read it, if not, here's the gist:
I was in a two year physically and emotionally abusive relationship. The physical abusive and a lot of the manipulation stemmed from the fact that I'm 99.9999% sure that he has bipolar disorder. He refused to seek help, and I feel responsible for whoever he gets close enough to hurt next. I feel like there's not much I can do now though...I don't want to ruin his life, rather I want him to start actually enjoying it. I was thinking family intervention maybe, but I would need to talk to his dad in person. And getting a point that had such a huge negative impact on my life across will be difficult for me in person.
The emotional abuse I endured killed my self-image. I've been working to rebuild it, but I also have a lot of issues just from being abused and being in that mindset that everything was ok for so long. I've talked to a few friends about it, but I feel like a burden. My family doesn't know at all; that's the hardest part.

o0pbq,"My coworker is in an abusive relationship, and I don't know what to do. Please help. My coworker is in an abusive relationship, and I don't know what to do. Please help.

They are in their mid-20s. She moved to Alberta (we live in **Canada**) 4 months ago, and her boyfriend moved here 3 months ago (one month after her). He doesn't work. She supports him. They live together, and have a one-year lease on a one-bedroom apartment. They have been together for one year.

She often mentions his emotional abuse, but on NYE (New Year's Eve), it escalated to physical violence. It all began with a ridiculous argument, and ended at their home, where she threw the first punch, he punched her back, and she somehow ended up with a long scrape on her face (she initially said that she fell, then told me that it is from the door hitting her face when she tried to hold it shut). Apparently he punched a hole through the door. A few days ago, she had scrapes on her hand, which she said were from punching a hole through a wall. She believes that she did/said something ""stupid"" enough to deserve getting punched.

She says that he resorted to squatting in an abandoned house in a dangerous neighborhood, when she kicked him out for a few weeks this cold winter. She says that part of the reason why she stays with him is because she enjoys the sex. She doesn't really seem to have any hobbies or goals, outside of the relationship. She has mentioned that she has anxiety all of the time, and that she is under occasional supervision by mental health professionals. She has expressed an interest in getting into martial arts.

From my limited perspective, I can tell that this is an extremely unhealthy relationship. I am really worried about her, and I don't know what to do. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

22u7ta,"Just venting/complaining. Throw away Hi guys, I don't know if what I'm going through is abuse. I don't think it is anymore but I just can't do it anymore. I've gained almost 100lbs because all I do is eat and cry. I apologize in advance for any rambling I am also not sleeping very well.

I've been with my husband(common law) for 16 years. For the first 10 everything was great. In my mind anyways. He's always been a little controlling and jealous of friends. But for the most post I was happy. I concentrated on the children and he concentrated on his job. 

About 6 years ago when we moved to the suburbs his personality completely changed and he bacame this like rage monster, he also started working out at this time. I had like zero defense I mean he was my whole life. I had no friends or family and he just tore me down so fast. Nothing was ever good enough, he was constantly yelling at me and insulting me and hurting me. 

Somehow I got through those years she now he is getting better, he hasn't yelled at me for almost a month. Just today he cleaned up the kitchen and living room and he's very proud of what he does.

But I just can't, I stay up all night crying because I'm so lonely and confused. I know he's doing good but I just can't stop thinking of him as this rage monster and I'm constantly on edge and terrified. I don't want this next thing I do to be the thing that makes him blow.

And I feel sooo guilty because why now when he's better. And I want to get away from him so bad. But of course. I have no money. Joint accounts. Everything in his name.

18rcz4,"My wife has anger issues and not sure what to do. My wife and I have been married going on 8 years.  We've had many problems and have done a lot of things to keep it going.  Going to counseling and all.  Currently though, there is an issue that has been ongoing, off and on, since our first child was still in the womb.

My wife gets angry.  Angry every day.  Angry at damn near anything she can focus it onto.  While pregnant with our first child, she would cause fights just for attention.  She has always been fearful of loosing me.  She fears I'm going to walk away one day. 

She's been pushing her anger onto my eldest since he was born.  I defend him as much as I can and step in when she gets too angry.  I make her leave the room to calm down often.  She tends to go a bit overboard with him all the time.  But, my youngest, she almost never does. 

Her first pregnancy was horrible.  Many complications, mental and physical issues, etc.  When he was two, it all but gone away and I thought we were in the clear.  I've always just summed up her anger as bad days.  But, recently, I've been recording it in a notebook.  After looking at this past month, I know she needs help.

I don't know what to do though.  Every time I bring it up, an argument ensues.  She always defends her actions.  Her defense is usually BS imo.  It's really starting to break us apart.  I need to find a way to tell her but I need a plan too.

We're very very poor.  We live in an area with little to no help.  The only place that can help is an hour drive away and only open while I work.  They have a sliding scale but I can't even meet it...  I just don't know what to do.  I want to stop the abuse of my child and me while keeping her as a wife.

1ovujm,"5 months just blown away in 5 minutes For five months now I have talked to this girl I like. It has been great, she puts a smile on my face, but even though we live close, I haven't gotten to go out with her due to sports and other stuff. So today at 12:30 in the morning she is texting me talking about making out and such, and it's getting kinda hot and heavy, then out of no where I get a big ""Fuck you, you are just an asshole, don't talk to me again."" Apparently I am supposed to know that when SHE starts talking about sexual matters I'm just supposed to say whoa whoa whoa, hold the phone! I don't want any of that shit, I just want to talk to you forever, endlessly, for the rest of eternity without even mentioning anything sexual. My bad, I guess I'm just a fucking douche because I went along with your god damn texts. I can't even believe I wasted this much fucking time talking to her just to be thrown out the damn window in a 5 minute conversation. Why the hell would you lead me on and not expect me to react the way I did. The sheer stupidity of this entire thing makes me want to bash my face into a bloody pulp against her fucking door, and ask her ""WHAT THE FUCKING HELL!?!?!?!?"" I am in disbelief at how stupid this ended. This situation makes me think about my future and potentially getting married. If I would get a divorce I would probably just kill myself.

27puae,"Someone pulled a gun on me last Monday. I know I should have felt fear but I just couldn't. Rage was the one and only thing that I felt. It was just some useless asshole who swerved across traffic, almost ran 2 cars off the road, then looped around and pulled next to me at the drivethrough.  I took the opportunity to flick asshole off and tell him to use his fucking blinkers next time.  And that's where it gets weird.  He pulled a pistol off of his lap and aimed it square at my face and started calling me a faggot and saying he was going to kill me.  

As for the homophobic slurs, I really couldn't care less.  I'm a confident straight man and I have gay and lesbian friends and slurs simply don't excite or offend me.  I've been known to roll my eyes when people disparaged my own mother.  Words really have very little effect on me.  But that gun...  That PISSED ME THE FUCK OFF.    

In retrospect of course I know what I should have done.  I should have high-tailed it out of there, called the police and then cowered somewhere.  But evidently when I'm threatened by a punk-assed bitch, that's not the side of me that comes out.  I immediately rammed his car and then things got serious very quickly.  I'll yadda yadda over the next 20 or so minutes for obvious reasons but you get the idea.  All that's important for this story is that in the end I drove away none the worse for wear. 

I know I should have done something else, anything else.  But the sight of that punk ass leveling a gun at my head flipped a switch that I have no access to.  I was full on raging and nothing else mattered.  I'm not even sure I remember all of it, I just wanted nothing more than to see his skull cracked open and I knew I wasn't going to back down.  Who the fuck was HE to pull a gun on me?  What made this guy feel he could do that?  And then not pull the trigger?  Fuck that guy, it was on.   


I guess I'm not sure why I posted this.  I'm not pleased that I have this switch in my head.  In some ways I'm sure it's served me well.  But in this instance, the proper course of action was obvious to everyone except me.  For me all I saw was red.  I went from happy hunter gatherer guy to a killer who would have taken a bite out of that useless bitch's still-beating heart.  

Am I broken?  Is there a way to keep that switch from getting flipped in the future?  I do not like the idea that people can manipulate me in any way, much less this one.  Uncontrollable bloodlust is not a trait that I want associated with me.

Later on he came in and took my phone thinking I'm going to cheat on him. Me being me, my emotions were crazy. I have never been slapped and it made me mad because we have never fought before. We are a wonderful couple together. But because I was upset I ran out and slapped him, I wanted it to be fair. It was not abuse to me, because I slapped him back and both of our reactions were automatic. We are rough people together in general. But then he grabbed me and started choking me. Not abnormal because we do that in bed and I completely let go and faint. He was checking and telling me to calm down. He didn't make me faint, and I know he could have. But now his mother is saying that I need to leave him because he's abusive and he will be to the baby and I. What do I do?

2bskt6,"Need help getting out of bad situation I live in Washington state with my partner. We have gone through dozens of cycles of abuse over 2 years...  constant rollercoaster jumping between the wonderful and the horrible; rape, intimidation, threats of violence, punching me until I'm on the ground and then holding my mouth and nose closed until I pass out, and that doesn't even scratch at the crazy making emotional abuse and the blaming our the constant accusations. Anyways, I don't have any real excuse for how I've let myself stay in this abusive situation other than that I love this person more than anything in the world and the thought of giving up on a happily ever after kills me inside. 

It has been a little more than three months since the last overt physical abuse (although not a week goes by now where I'm not blamed for something like ""talking back"", screamed at, and given the silent treatment). Only now I find out that I can't break my lease unless the abuse was in the last 90 days. Things have gotten a lot worse fast in the last 2 months, I feel terrified every day and it is becoming more clear to me the way this person is manipulating me. If they say or accuse me of something and are factually incorrect, my correcting them invariably leads to hours of yelling and blaming. They are incapable of admitting to their obvious lies, and instead fall back to convincing other people they are right or me that I have bad memory. I want out, but I'm stuck here in this expensive apartment with someone in terrified of who had made it clear that unless I'm going to submit to them completely physically and emotionally I'm a valid target. 

What do I do? I'm really terrified. I live in Seattle. How do I get real help? Is my only option to just run and take the financial hit to my credit? I've spent so much money on them I don't know how I'll get by with what I have and my injuries hurt me do much it is difficult to work.

Please someone tell me what to do

2dpi2d,"Wide awake and full of anxiety because of my past. I was awoken from a dead sleep about an hour ago by my neighbor screaming. I live in a concrete block townhome and while I can sometimes hear noises I have never heard words this clearly. I immediately woke up with my heart racing because of this as it triggered something in my mind. I am an adult survivor of domestic violence and I know my neighbors are a couple with 3 kids. I didn't hear any crying or anything like that. I also didn't hear any crashing of banging. I only heard the man yelling. Waking up like that I felt like every piece of my body was on high alert and I was ready to do something. It triggered something inside me... A feeling I've not felt in a very long time. The fear of hearing it all over again and being brought back to a time where I listened from my bedroom, eyes peering under the bedroom door, waiting for my opportunity to run and hit the silent alarm to save my mom from my stepdad. I felt like I was 8 years old again... And it terrified me.  I listened at the wall and heard him go downstairs. I then heard him talking and more cursing but no yelling. Then the doorbell rang and I got a glimpse of what looked like the woman standing at the door. But it may be been their eldest daughter.  

I don't know, my mind is racing wondering if I should do something more. I promised myself as a kid if I ever encountered it in the future I would do something since in my life nobody ever did, not even the cops. However I also know that in relationships argents happen... And this is the first time I've ever heard anything more than the muffled noise of a tv from next door. 

I wish I didn't have this reaction... And I wish I could just go back to sleep...

2revkx,"I am at my wit's end with regards to an (abused) friend's mental state A friend of mine reached out to me a few weeks ago about a situation involving some pretty bad stuff.  Forgive me if I don't go into details about what happened, but the person responsible is in jail at the moment, and my friend is crashing on my couch.  She is homeless because of this situation, her car was stolen, her relationship with her family is strained, and I am ill-equipped to help her beyond a short term stay in my apartment.

I cannot convince her to take advantage of services for battered women in the area, such as help with housing, counseling, and job placement. Her financial resources are basically zero.

I don't think she is in a good state of mind.  She recently professed her love for me during her stay, and made a comment about forcing herself on me. This makes things incredibly awkward for me.  It's not healthy for her to be here if she has some sort of limerant feelings (though they could be related to the trauma she went through,) and I don't want to be someone's emotional pillar.  My apartment is not very big.  

I am concerned she might try something while I am sleeping.  I'm not unsympathetic; it's freezing outside and she has been through a lot, but I want her gone after the advances she made the night before.  I can offer her a car ride to some sort of Women's shelter or the Y, but she is stubborn about going to those places.

mt721,"How to be a true friend to someone in a physically abusive relationship she doesn't want to leave? My best friend is in a physically abusive relationship.   They share an apartment.  She's in her early 20s, he's in his early 30s.

As I'm now learning, she's never been in a relationship that wasn't physically abusive (since her early teens).  Her last relationship was far more abusive, so I suppose this is an improvement, but the guy she's with now, once lost his temper and killed someone (this isn't the US, she's American, he's not).  He loves her, and she loves him, and when they fight, it gets violent sometimes.  To the extent that she has to visit the hospital the next day and most recently, may well have permanently damaged her physically.

I know she needs to leave him--and I and lots of other friends have already told her this.  She doesn't want to hear it--says we don't understand, says she's attracted to these kinds of guys and that's just how it is.  This guy is better than the last so she can handle it.

I don't know how to be a friend in this situation.  I care about her, she's been an amazing friend to me, and she's such a strong, tough, together person otherwise.  

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this before--either as the friend or the person being abused?  How can I be a friend to her?  We talk about it sometimes, either me trying to get through by listening and asking questions, or me loosing patience and stating the facts of her reality, which probably just sounds like judgement and lecture from her side.

Any stories, advice, or insight, please--I don't know what to do, I don't even want to look at the guy and it's hard not to just throw up my hands in frustration and walk away sometimes.  Is there any hope?  How can I be a friend without enabling her relationship?

TLDR:  How to be a true friend to someone who knows they're in an abusive relationship, thinks that's the best they can do, isn't attracted to ""nice guys,"" and doesn't want to leave?

2ilrqd,"I'm a survivor who has anxiety attacks when abuse is even discussed and I need help I'm an older male survivor of sexual abuse (from when I was six) and have had depression/anxiety issues for many years. To further describe myself, I have multiple health issues and am gay and don't date much (if at all in the last few years - this is important later) and have had a long-time doctor (not a counselor, physical doctor) who helps me deal with my daily pain. 

I have full-blown anxiety/panic attacks anytime anyone discusses child abuse as the words themselves (not a flashback) evoke a huge wave of fear/revulsion. This has happened to me for years and I don't know why this happens (I can understand it, I just don't know if it is common? Why does just hearing the terms make me so upset?). I have had a few occasions when the subject was broached and I turned beet red in the face and have left the room because of the issue and have received odd looks because of it. 

Recently, this same thing happened during a doctor's appointment and I could not leave and the doctor looked at me oddly after the session was done. I live in the south where some people (not all) already equate being gay with attacking children and last week I overheard my doctor speaking to his wife about me and thinking I am some sort of horrible criminal.

I am devastated and humiliated and horrified that someone would think that of me. I don't know what to do or how to fix it. Everything I think of would make it worse and I don't know how to face him. I can't even think about functioning in my daily life knowing someone thinks THAT about me. I don't even think I can have a discussion with him about this without a full blown panic attack, making everything worse (?). My life feels like it is in limbo until this is fixed. 

Any advice would be appreciated. Is this normal? Has this ever happened to anyone else or am I alone?

wn8to,"Best friend has just admitted her boyfriend is scaring her and keeping her from their infant child She is going to a shelter today to get help with getting a protection order and legal advice.

She is my best friend and I had to move out-of-state 2 years ago for a job. She met this guy and very quickly was pregnant. She told me this morning he has been emotionally abusive and verbally assaulting her. He screams at her, shaking like he's going to hit her, and when the baby begins crying, he stands between her and the baby and won't let her go near the baby. He tells her she is crazy, that it's postpartum depression and his behavior is normal and ok.

Yesterday she said they were fine, and then in the middle of the grocery store he goes off, screaming at her and berating her. She tried to leave and he followed her out of the store, screaming at her. She went back in and had to get security to walk her out to her car so she could go home safely.

She has no job, a 3 month old and has been receiving state medical insurance and WIC. She is utterly alone. She comes from and abusive family (physically, emotionally and sexually) and they support this boyfriend, of course. They keep telling her she is crazy and just likes to hold grudges. She half believes them, I am trying to make her see they are abusive and to distance herself from them, no matter how much she loves them.

She wants to come to live with me where I am but I am worried about the legal ramifications for her. She is in Arizona and his name is on the birth certificate. She gets governemnt support and if she leaves, she will lose her food stamps, and the baby will lose his medical coverage.

Is there anything else she should do or I should do? I am hoping the shelter can help take care of the legal aspects and help her on the road to getting full custody. They stated they were not sure the behavior was abuse and she will have to talk to CPS. This worries me. 

I just don't know what else to do. Any advice is welcome.

1jp1jh,"How to support my sister Hello reddit. My sister was recently (less than a month ago) a victim of domestic violence. I don't have all the details but from what I gather, her partner, whom she lives with, physically assaulted her. He went to jail for about a week and came back to sexually assault her. She got a restriction order and lifted it in a week, I believe so that he could see his kids. My sister has not dropped charges on the initial assault and has asked for my help in relocating to a different city. We live in CA and I believe that her expenses, coupled with the fact that they have four kids, will not allow her to survive on her own. She's unlikely to ask for child support or any government aid. She was at a women's shelter for a weekend but reports that her kids couldn't stand it.

She asked me to move out with her, but unfortunately I just signed a new lease with a new roommate and I'm tied down. I have sufficient savings to probably keep her afloat in this town for three months, but I would prefer to send her to a cheaper town with more jobs available to her. I have a friend in mind who could help me set this up and she has a car (that she's still paying, though she has worked 3 days out of two weeks with her ongoing problems) for errands and school. However, I don't know whether she has custody, and I'm in need of someone who can help figure it out. Her children are all under 12, and she and her partner are unmarried. Can she legally pick her things up and move to a different state without the government (state or federal) chasing her? Can I realistically get her moved within a week? Is there an org that can help her figure out the legal mess without being judgmental?

25k34i,"Neighbor single mother abusing her kids Throwaway account here.

I've been living in a bad part of Oakland for about a year and a half and have gotten used to a lot of things. Lots of noise at all hours, day in and day out.

I'm not the confrontational type and don't like to get involved in other peoples business, but this has been bugging me for awhile. 

This middle aged single mother and her three kids (one around 3 or 4 and the others around 8 or 10) moved in next door about half a year ago and it has been terrible ever since. 

She's always yelling at her kids and threatening them with violence. I often hear her hitting them and they cry and scream a lot. It's terrible for the kids and also really disruptive to my life. My old roommate called CPS once when it was really bad, but when OPD came to check it out things were quieter and they took the mothers side of the story.

It seems to be the norm around here to yell and sometimes hit your kids if they're misbehaving, but this is too much. I have an audio recording taken from my balcony of her hitting and yelling at her kids inside her house. It's so loud I can hear it from my room. 

I don't want to have to deal directly with authorities, but I do want to make her stop beating her kids and yelling all the time.

2z7soz,"How does therapy help? Very brief back story: I'm an adult survivor of incest and until the age of 14 I was raised almost solely by a parent with un-diagnosed bipolar disorder as well as issues from their own childhood trauma. I would like to share my whole story, but I'm not sure I'm ready so that is for another time and another thread.

I have been in and out of therapy my whole life. Recently, I'm back in therapy. So far we have determined that I suffer from PTSD, which is a great start. I've been put on anti-depressant and anti-anxiety meds but obviously I need ongoing therapy as well.

I've been feeling like my therapist doesn't really know what she's doing. I've seen her for 6 sessions and I don't feel at all capable of coping with my problems. She focuses on little symptoms - here's how to help with insomnia, here's how you could maybe tolerate going to the grocery store alone, that kind of thing. That's all helpful to some, limited extent but I don't feel like it's helping me to process the root problems at all. 

I'm starting to wonder what kind of things I should be getting out of therapy. Is it just coping mechanisms for every-day problems? Should we be delving into the abuse? Is the benefit from talking about the abuse simply getting it out? Should therapy be helping to reduce the flashbacks, hyper-awareness, nightmares, etc? I don't need someone to talk to for an hour a week. I don't need someone to tell me about sleep hygiene and how exercising more can help me feel better. I can get that on the internet. I need to overcome my trauma. Therapy is supposed to do that, right?

What kinds of benefits should I be seeing from therapy? Can it actually help or do I just need to rely on medications for the rest of my life? Are there signs that I need to look for a better therapist? Any help, advice, experience, etc. would be lovely to hear.

hmygg,"(x-post from /r/suicidewatch) Need help with a Suicidal Girl I just met online. This is a weird story. Please note that I am not a good person but just give me something that I can use to help her. I'm in a bad situation and I refuse to hurt her any further than I may have already.

So you know, she's 15 and I'm 18.

We met in a teen chat room and moved over to skype pretty quickly for sexual stuff. The next time I see her she explodes on me saying that I only like her for her body. I convince her that this wasn't the case but she still is acting funny. I asked if there was anything else that was wrong.

She says her father has been hitting her and her mother, drinks heavily, and has started to grope her body. He also quit his job to become a freelance photographer so there is no money. Her mom refused to believe her about the touchings.

She has no surviving family left besides one aunt who is already overburdened with debt and just had her assets liquidated. Her mom also has MS with no proper insurance and cannot work. Perhaps worst of all, her abusive home has given her a very biting and scathing personality which leaves her with very few friends. If she goes to social services it is most likely that she will forever live a life of poverty.

I know she isn't trolling because I watched her break down in tears and start cutting herself. Because she decided to trust me before I don't think I can leave her now. She keeps saying that she just needs her soul mate to come and take her away but that can't be me.

WTF do I do to help her?

1131ul,"I thought I was over it. I've always prided myself on how normal I am considering my past. Sure, I was sexually abused as a child by my own grandfather but look at how I'm a productive member of society! Education, marriage, good job. I thought these things were the proof of how the abuse hadn't affected me.

My abuser died when I was still young, I accepted the fact that I would never get justice and that, really, there was no point in harping on about something that could never change. When friends opened up to me about their experiences I was able to relate and support. I told my husband so he could understand why every now and then I'd freak out.

I'm a normal, functioning human. Yes, there's depression and the occasional suicidal thought (almost never an action) but so many people have the same so I decided the two things weren't related.

This next part may not make sense to some of you but this last week or so I've been faced with some unpleasant situations all because of Jimmy Fucking Savile. All of a sudden I can't cope with hearing the tasteless jokes, I don't want to hear about people doubting the women coming forward and it's making me re-evaluate how over my experience I truly am.

The worst part has been realising that I enjoyed my abuse. How fucking sick is that? What is wrong with me to make me feel that way? I can justify it. I was very young when it started, until my mother found out I didn't even know it was wrong, just that it was a secret. He did things that felt good. And he was my grandfather.

Everything started when my sister first got pregnant. Around my sister 2 month mark, her ""spouse"" broke her jaw. My sister had to have surgery done to fix it and her spouse went to prison for 1 year for the attack. 
(She wasn't the one to report to the police the incident. Our mother reported it when she drove her to the hospital.)

During the period her ""spouse"" was locked up, my sister started shutting out all contacts with the family, claiming that we were trying to break up her family, and were out to get her. Thankfully she maintained contact with me. I tried my hardest during this period to help her change her life, and get away from the environment she was living in. She started doing really well, until I left for the military. From there her ""spouse"" was released and without anyone there to support her, fell back into the environment she just came from.

A few months later she moved to Colorado to try to build back the relationship with our family. There, her ""spouse"" started abusing her again, at this point she started living with our mother.
Her ""spouse"" recently made a trip back up to Colorado, (currently having a warrant for his arrest for assault and failure to appear to court), my sister took my nephew and left with him.

I'm the only person she trust and will maintain contact with, how can I help her out so she can end the cycle that she has been in.

So the police didn't do anything. They won't do anything unless physical violence occurs recently or in the near future. So that didn't work, despite my attempts at telling my story. My counselor and I finally got a hold of CPS, and I got a case manager. This is mainly for family counseling and individual counseling.

Though today I spoke with a man from our local Family Reconciliation Center. I filled out a CHINS petition. I'm curious, do any of you have any knowledge of the CHINS petition? I can't seem to find any stories out there.

1uj0qt,"We're only on our 3rd date - I'm already in a constant state of anxiety. Help! (xpost /r/anxiety) Hello friends,


I am 22 have recently met a man with whom I am beginning my very first relationship. Mostly I feel happy about it, but inside I am battling my anxiety and fear of intimacy (due to childhood sexual and emotional abuse) right now I'm feeling awful and I'm not sure what to do. I would appreciate some help.


On New Years Eve I met a really lovely and interesting guy. I thought he was physically attractive straight away and I was hoping he would come and talk to me. Finally we got the chance to talk and he turned out to be genuinely kind and funny. We swapped numbers and agreed to meet for drinks a week later.


Since then we have been on two dates. On the first one there was no physical intimacy at all; no hand-holding, no hugs. On the second we both made our feelings a little clearer and we held hands and hugged frequently. He said that he really liked me and that he would like to continue to go out with me. I agreed and for the most part I was very happy. But whenever I spend time with him, my mind swings between being happy and comfortable to being terrified and out of control.


I will be okay holding hands one moment, then a few minutes later the idea repulses me. I was terrified through both dates that he would try to kiss me. I got the very strong feeling that he wanted to and I felt guilty for not being able to do it. The idea of kissing would send me into a near anxiety-attack. Inside my head I was freaking out.


At the end of the second date we finally kissed. Just a small one. I couldn't bear to do anything more. At first I felt nothing. No joy or happiness, but no disgust either. But almost immediately, I became overwhelmed with horrible feelings. I feel disgusting, dirty, anxious and totally out of control.


It's been 3 days since then and I cannot get it out of my head. I am excited when he texts me and I am looking forward to seeing him again. But the other part of me is terrified. When I'm feeling bad I can't even look at photos of him without feeling sick. I can't bare to think too much about our last two dates because it brings on the anxiety all over again. There's a small part of me that wants to just cancel everything, break up with him and hide alone in my house. I feel ashamed because I have been working in therapy for years now so I could be in a fulfilling relationship. I want to experience love. I want to explore this relationship to see where it goes. I want to be 'normal'.


Even when he's not around I'm always thinking ""What if he wants me to have sex with him? What if he wants to kiss me again, or worse, kiss for longer? What if these bad feelings never go away?""


I'm feeling scared right now, and my head feels all mixed up. Please if anyone has any suggestions about how to work through this, I would really like to hear them.


Much love.",abuse,"['rd', 'date', 'already', 'constant', 'state', 'anxiety', 'help', 'xpost', 'r', 'anxiety', 'hello', 'friends', 'recently', 'met', 'man', 'beginning', 'first', 'relationship', 'mostly', 'feel', 'happy', 'inside', 'battling', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'due', 'childhood', 'sexual', 'emotional', 'abuse', 'right', 'feeling', 'awful', 'sure', 'would', 'appreciate', 'help', 'new', 'years', 'eve', 'met', 'really', 'lovely', 'interesting', 'guy', 'thought', 'physically', 'attractive', 'straight', 'away', 'hoping', 'would', 'come', 'talk', 'finally', 'got', 'chance', 'talk', 'turned', 'genuinely', 'kind', 'funny', 'swapped', 'numbers', 'agreed', 'meet', 'drinks', 'week', 'later', 'since', 'two', 'dates', 'first', 'one', 'physical', 'intimacy', 'hand', 'holding', 'hugs', 'second', 'made', 'feelings', 'little', 'clearer', 'held', 'hands', 'hugged', 'frequently', 'said', 'really', 'liked', 'would', 'like', 'continue', 'go', 'agreed', 'part', 'happy', 'whenever', 'spend', 'time', 'mind', 'swings', 'happy', 'comfortable', 'terrified', 'control', 'okay', 'holding', 'hands', 'one', 'moment', 'minutes', 'later', 'idea', 'repulses', 'terrified', 'dates', 'would', 'try', 'kiss', 'got', 'strong', 'feeling', 'wanted', 'felt', 'guilty', 'able', 'idea', 'kissing', 'would', 'send', 'near', 'anxiety', 'attack', 'inside', 'head', 'freaking', 'end', 'second', 'date', 'finally', 'kissed', 'small', 'one', 'could', 'bear', 'anything', 'first', 'felt', 'nothing', 'joy', 'happiness', 'disgust', 'either', 'almost', 'immediately', 'became', 'overwhelmed', 'horrible', 'feelings', 'feel', 'disgusting', 'dirty', 'anxious', 'totally', 'control', 'days', 'since', 'get', 'head', 'excited', 'texts', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'part', 'terrified', 'feeling', 'bad', 'even', 'look', 'photos', 'without', 'feeling', 'sick', 'bare', 'think', 'much', 'last', 'two', 'dates', 'brings', 'anxiety', 'small', 'part', 'wants', 'cancel', 'everything', 'break', 'hide', 'alone', 'house', 'feel', 'ashamed', 'working', 'therapy', 'years', 'could', 'fulfilling', 'relationship', 'want', 'experience', 'love', 'want', 'explore', 'relationship', 'see', 'goes', 'want', 'normal', 'even', 'around', 'always', 'thinking', 'wants', 'sex', 'wants', 'kiss', 'worse', 'kiss', 'longer', 'bad', 'feelings', 'never', 'go', 'away', 'feeling', 'scared', 'right', 'head', 'feels', 'mixed', 'please', 'anyone', 'suggestions', 'work', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'hear', 'much', 'love']"

1xnjen,"My story / vent (long, lots of triggers) Keeping the backstory a little brief. I'm not sure how much of this or what will even come out.

When I was 8 I made friends with a girl (I'm a girl as well) who had just moved to town. We became close really fast as I was always an outcast and she was the new kid. I spent a lot of time at her house. My first memory of anything was being over there in the summer and her and I playing in the dirt and mud, and her mom made us take a bath before dinner. I must have been staying the night like I did so often. What I can remember is being stripped down and put in this rusty, dirty old tub. The faucet jammed into my back when I sat down and she sat on the opposite end. Her mom ran her spidery scraggly fingers through my hair and to this day I hate being touched on the scalp. Her mom made us wash each other and when she touched me I resisted and she hit me. When we got out of the bath I remember her hugging me and telling me she didn't mean it and that she only did it because she loved me. I was a real quiet kid at the time and my parents were narcissistic, which I didn't know/realize until years later.

This abuse went on until I was 10 and the principal at my school barred us from being near each other because we had become extreme issues in class. Both of our parents were angry and so we saw limited amounts of each other after that. For 2 years I was bound at the wrists, made to pose for her stepdad, I had pictures taken of me that I have no idea if they ended up in circulation, I was given benadryl on more than one occasion and I can remember waking up at the dinner table there once before. These people told me they loved me and they bribed me with things I didn't have at home like video games and they said I was special when they took my picture. I was burned with cigarettes whenever I resisted them and as time went on I refused to take a bath at my own house, to which my mother would get into fights and hit me over. I had bruises almost all the time and she would never know what was what. I couldn't bathe myself and I couldn't wear restrictive clothes. I'd cry at school and I developed severe OCD, especially with germs. I was extremely ritualistic and I had nervous tics. The school nurse used to let me sleep in the office during recess and every time she called my mother, she told me I was faking it for attention. 

I did a complete 180 as a child and as my life went on I ended up becoming an alcoholic and a drug addict, which I'm in recovery today, and I was such a maladjusted person until I started to get some recovery in me. I'm just starting my journey of opening up about my abuse and it's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Constantly I'm plagued with vague memories that I can't help but think are made up, severe guilt, severe shame, and cluelessness. I was tortured.

Anyways, it feels good to be able to be open about what I can right now. I have a great therapist but I guess I'm also looking for other resources that can help me out on sorting out these feelings and issues.

2kgvrm,"Dealing with seeing my abuser I have an ex that I have a restraining order against.  It is a no contact order and not a stay away order.  We share a mutual interest, and he has used that as an excuse to tip toe around the restraining order (via following me to events, talking to people next to me, but not directly at me).  If i go away for the weekend, he harasses the people I am visiting (often these are public events and he looks me up constantly).  

It's been hell dealing with and the criminal justice system has completely failed in prosecuting him for his persistent and constant violations of the order (I have video of him admitting to raping me, where he knew he was being recorded, and the criminal prosecutor told m e he would charge me with wire tapping if i continued to pursue the issue).

The restraining order has only stopped him from contacting me but not everyone around me, so my life has continued to be hell for eight months.  I've managed to avoid seeing him (with the exception of once, where he tried to file harassment charges on me - literally, for enforcing my restraining order, those charges were dropped) lately, BUT the restraining order ends in February.

I've spent years establishing myself in this field and i do NOT want to give up everything I have worked for because of this piece of shit.

But at some point, at a minimum when the restraining order is over, I will have to face him.

How do I manage to run these events, stay a strong leader in my field, and keep a smile on my face while seeing and dealing with (he won't stop the harassment on others and i am sure it will start back up to me once the order expires) my rapist?

I understand that my state CT does not release victim information does this go so far as closing all the records about his side of the restraining order? She gave me her full name and the district it was filed in - i cannot find it under her name or his.

I am very concerned for my sister as this situation seems to be escalating - he is starting with obsessive texts and calls and emails etc..  Up to this point he has not hit my sister or shown signs that he ever would - so she has said.

She has not told him she talked with the ex for fear of escalation - she told him she was going to and he started crying uncontrollably trying to convince her not to call saying things like 'i'm telling you the truth i told you i cheated on her what more do you need?'  and 'i'm trying to be the man you want by being honest'  but he was excessively distraught at the thought oh my sister calling and talking to this woman.  

My tendency is to believe her - this man has been caught cheating and lieing already - his behavior upon hearing my sister was going to speak with her was ......beyond abnormal.  I mean if he just cheated on her why the theatrics?

This is the kicker - this man has been INCREDIBLY good to my sister - on the surface as far as i know.  My sister is at a turning point here.  Believe that this round of cheating (the first time my sister is catching him) was a 'mistake' and move forward or get out of the relationship.

I feel like I'm going to die no less angry than I am now, probably more. That it's never going to leave me (not that I am actively angry all the time). Just have it bottled up inside forever.

14k85x,"Can't seem to escape my past.. When I was younger, about 15, I was in a heavily abusive relationship with a boy just a few weeks older. At first it wasn't bad, our relationship was amazing (I know.. We were 15 but it was the first real relationship I had ever had.) He was really sweet and treated me better than anyone before. 
About two months into our relationship he began to control me, I was so young I had no idea. He isolated me from my friends, gave me a strict set of rules, and began to call me nasty things (half of them I had never heard before). 
One day I started asking questions I shouldn't have about why his parents treated him so terribly. That's when the physical abuse started.. He grabbed a knife a cut his first initial into my arm.. Claiming me as his property.. 
He threatened me not to tell anyone. And the abuse got worse. 
I went through my own hell and no one seemed to notice. I had stupid stories to cover up why I was hurt (everyone teased me for being a klutz) but no one stopped to ask what actually was happening. 
He ended up moving across the country when his dad got a new job. After 8 months of torture I was finally free. But I was still too terrified to tell anyone. Afraid that he would return. 
After a few months I opened up to my closest friends and half of them didn't believe me because I never said anything while it was happening. 
I didn't start getting help (with therapy) until after high school graduation when I finally told my mother about my ex.
Currently I am a college freshman (19 years old) studying to become a teacher. I've moved out of state and have a whole new support system here. But I am still struggling everyday. 
My therapist told me I have PTSD and depression from the trauma I went through and that it will take a while to heal. 
I'm struggling with the fact that I still have nightmares and flashbacks from what happened. All of my friends are trying to be helpful and supportive but they don't know everything about what I went through and just try to distract me. I'm afraid I'll never escape what my ex did to me. It's easier for me to talk about now that I've started getting help but I still fight everyday to be happy. 

Will this ever get easier?

What else can I do?

28l99v,"A terrified wife trying to understand I need some feedback, and I'm desperately wanting it to be the feedback I'm hoping for. 

A little background: I have been with my husband for 4 years.  He is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse.  The man that abused him did so from the age of 3 - 10.  

My husband struggles with his past and has had many negative consequences due to what was done to him.  He was (is?) addicted to porn.  He claims that he hasn't looked at any since last november, but I'm not sure if this is the truth or if he has gotten better at hiding it.  In the past I have caught him on dating sites, cam show sites, and bestiality sites.  

In what was probably one of the most traumatizing event of my life, two years ago I found two child porn videos on his computer.  To make matters even more revolting, one of the videos was of an infant.  I confronted him about this and asked if he was aroused when watching.  He looked at me, defeated, and said 'no, I'm just trying to understand how someone can do that to a kid.'  I really want to believe him. 

I've been supporting him throughout our marriage with his issues, but we just had our first child two months ago.  Due to his job in the military, he hasn't been home since she was born.  However, he will be coming home for good in September.  I can't help but be constantly paranoid that he might abuse her.  I don't want to put my daughter at risk and I've been doing a lot of soul searching to determine what I should do.  My husband is a good man and I love him very much, but what if he turns out to be a child molester?  How would I ever forgive myself?  On the other hand, what if what he was saying about why he watched the videos was true?  I would be abandoning a man who has trusted me enough to open up about the most shameful experiences of his life.  

I guess my question is: For other CSA survivors, have any of you watched children getting abused not because it aroused you, but because you were looking for answers?",abuse,"['terrified', 'wife', 'trying', 'understand', 'need', 'feedback', 'desperately', 'wanting', 'feedback', 'hoping', 'little', 'background', 'husband', 'years', 'survivor', 'childhood', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'man', 'abused', 'age', 'husband', 'struggles', 'past', 'many', 'negative', 'consequences', 'due', 'done', 'addicted', 'porn', 'claims', 'looked', 'since', 'last', 'november', 'sure', 'truth', 'gotten', 'better', 'hiding', 'past', 'caught', 'dating', 'sites', 'cam', 'show', 'sites', 'bestiality', 'sites', 'probably', 'one', 'traumatizing', 'event', 'life', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'found', 'two', 'child', 'porn', 'videos', 'computer', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'revolting', 'one', 'videos', 'infant', 'confronted', 'asked', 'aroused', 'watching', 'looked', 'defeated', 'said', 'trying', 'understand', 'someone', 'kid', 'really', 'want', 'believe', 'supporting', 'throughout', 'marriage', 'issues', 'first', 'child', 'two', 'months', 'ago', 'due', 'job', 'military', 'home', 'since', 'born', 'however', 'coming', 'home', 'good', 'september', 'help', 'constantly', 'paranoid', 'might', 'abuse', 'want', 'put', 'daughter', 'risk', 'lot', 'soul', 'searching', 'determine', 'husband', 'good', 'man', 'love', 'much', 'turns', 'child', 'molester', 'would', 'ever', 'forgive', 'hand', 'saying', 'watched', 'videos', 'true', 'would', 'abandoning', 'man', 'trusted', 'enough', 'open', 'shameful', 'experiences', 'life', 'guess', 'question', 'csa', 'survivors', 'watched', 'children', 'getting', 'abused', 'aroused', 'looking', 'answers']"
12zxoj,"I'm a 17 year old girl. Abused physically by my father in the past and continually abused emotionally. Parents are both alcohol abusers. I am a 17 year old girl who has suffered emotional and, in the past, physical abuse from my father. He has choked me and punched me. My parents belittle, degrade, and interrogate me. They are high-functioning alcoholics who are drunk by 5 PM. My extended family sees them as saints, due to me and my twin sister being honors students. That's just a quick and dirty summary, as you can see, of what my home life is like.

I just recently contacted my school counselor about the abuse that my sister and I have gone through. She gave me my options, educated me on them, gave me advice, and now I have to make the call before anything happens.

I want to leave my home. I feel unsafe and scared being around my father. I never truly know if I am safe today, or tomorrow. He could beat me again like he has in the past.

The only logical way I can leave my home now, and immediately, is to get CPS involved. I don't want to deal with the court system, but I can tolerate it if this is the best option for me. I worry that my parents will explode. I know that my whole life will alter in ways that I can't predict, and this scares me. I'm worried that I will be making a mistake, but the other part of me knows that I need to do this if I want to be safe.

Have any of you been in this situation before? If so, should I stop being so nervous and make the call before I get hurt again? Do you have any advice for someone like me? I'm so worried that I'll call CPS and they won't care, or I won't be able to leave my home.

Thank you so much.

2ut490,"My SIL is very abusive to her husband and my niece and nephew. I am the only one who thinks we should intervene. My husbands brother and his family came to visit us for Christmas. His wife was horribly rude and was very physical with the children.  She was also emotionally cruel to the kids and my BIL. 

She was pregnant over the visit and continued to smoke cigarettes, weed and drink a lot of coffee.  She hardly ate.  We got into a verbal fight when I got fed up with her rudeness and asked her to calm down. She lost her mind. I lost my temper and they left. 

A few days later she sends me a really paranoid text message and says she is ""done with me"". She is the type to use FB as a way to passive agressivly attack people and she assumed I was doing the same by posting an article about how some customers are beyond rude (she totally fits into that category but I was sharing because a friend is in retail and we laugh at the craziness that happens at her job). She goes on to post how wonderful her life is and everything is perfect. Then blocks me and my husband. 

My partner and I have been talking about contact social services because of the abuse.  it's not life threatening but it is going to fuck up those kids.  We were also VERY concerned for the unborn baby. 

We took my therapists advice and spoke to my husbands parents (the grandparents of the kids) and they lost their shit on us.  How dare we bring this to them. They know about the abuse and there is nothing they can do. It's not that bad. They don't agree with our lifestyle either (we don't abuse children but apparently our adult choices that only impact other consenting adults is the same as abusing a child - sorry ranty).

Also - in this discussion that told us that my BILs wife had miscarried and she is claiming it happened the day they left our house. Which is impossible because a week later she was doing her showy facebook thing. Well now my BIL has blocked me and has limited my husband.  This has hurt my husband immensely and he is a very patient and kind person. 

So we have lost a tonne of respect for my husbands parents and are devastated that the children are going to live in an abusive home. My BIL seems defeated as his wife has physically attacked him in front of the kids and she thrives on drama and screaming. 

I not only want to help these kids but I feel I HAVE to help these kids. I was so badly abused as a child and I know what these kids are in for. I can't sleep. I cry constantly. I am working with my mental health team to help me with the emotions it has brought forward. 

Am I just putting myself through hell by wanting to help? Everyone tells me I am fighting a battle i can't win. I know the kids aren't being beaten but they are being hurt physically and emotionally. they are also not being socialized and are never dressed for the weather. They are very developmentally delayed and their mother spends all her time watching the real housewives garbage.

1ic0a5,"Need some help Recently my mother and I have come to terms about the physical and mental abuse my father has put us through (my mother went through this with her father as well). We can't really turn to our friends about this, but I am hoping we can get some insight from others who may have experienced this as well. 

From the age of 2 to about the age of 12, I used to avoid my dad as much as possible. The reason was that if I questioned anything, did something different he didn't like, or just happened to be around when he was mad at something else, I used to get yelled at or sometimes have the crap beaten out of me with a belt or his bare hands. A strong memory of the time was when I was 3 and refused to eat some rice, he proceeded to beat me till I puked a little rice up. Another was when I was 10, I forgot the reason why he did this but to avoid anyone hearing what was happening he hoisted me by the neck against the wall and proceeded to yell at me. I have that constant fear of him to this day.

When I turned 13 was when the majority of the physical abuse stopped and the mental abuse ramped up. I am a bright student and I was so back then, but whenever I would do something good he'd respond with some dumbass story of his childhood, tell me how stupid I am, and that I'm retarded. He'd diminish everything I did, never once giving me credit for more than 2 minutes. God forbid he say he was proud of me in front of people. If I tried to interact with him, within 3 minutes he would release a flurry of curse words and insults in my direction. Believe it or not, he was the only one who ever called me those names and cruel insults.

I'm 23 now, in the past week my mother and I have shared out experiences about my dad with each other. She has endured such abuse from her father and my father for the past 40 years. We agreed to act as a team, but I don't know how to heal what was done to me and my mother. I don't want to carry this on with my family when I have one, and I refuse to repeat this cycle with anyone.

25paud,"Need relief Basically, I have a very violent past. From when I was small up until about 3 years ago (I'm 19 now) I solved literally everything with violence. I'm pretty sure I've broken at least 8 bones (in other people's bodies) and did some major damage to random objects. If I got angry I just blacked out and that was the end of whoever was nearby trying to stop 
From when I was 5 until when I was 12 I've had to take a very high dose of Risperdal, which caused me to go into a.. well.. I didn't feel anything at all, so it's not a depression, but it was quite similar. When I stopped I had way less anger issues but still was very violent (solved my problems like that since I remember). About 3 years ago I went to a different school which was literally the opposite of any other school. Teachers were pretty much there to give you there knowledge when you asked, and other than that you could do whatever you wanted as long as you didn't bother anyone with it. The only thing that was strictly forbidden was violence (both physical and emotional). It took some getting used to, I was used to ducking and then hitting back as soon as someone stretched out their hand, but that was all not the case. I calmed down, and I'm still not likely to hit someone. I'm not likely to react at all, no matter how angry or frustrated I get. I stop and think and I just don't do anything.

This'd be a good thing, accept I'm done. In the last 3 years the violence towards me (at home, from my parents and siblings) continued, and instead of fighting back I accepted it. The school forced me to not fight, but at home that was not an option. Now I've got 3 years of rage built up inside and if I don't somehow let it go I'm going to end up killing someone.

I want to pick up a sport or something, have an equal fight with someone of the exact same strength, continue until one or the other gives up or is knocked out.

1bdy96,"Getting involved with someone who has been abused in the past - what to expect? Hi all,

I've been reading through these threads and I'm so so impressed by the strength and support of this community. It's remarkable to see people having each other's backs like this. I apologize if anything I say below is insensitive or incorrect - that is not my intention whatsoever!

I'm a 25M getting involved with a 20F. She has told me that she had been physically abused by an ex. I haven't asked for details, as I figure she'll open up when she's comfortable with it. Thus far, it seems fairly clear that when she experiences a trigger (a dream, for example), her reaction is to close herself off and push others away, rather than open up.

She has asked me to be patient with her while she learns to be comfortable and be open with someone, something which I promised I would be.

My question to you all is this: what sort of challenges can I expect, and what is the best way for me to be supportive? I don't want to say anything to her to make anything worse when she's in one of those closed off states, for example. I'd like to be properly equipped, so that I can be the best partner for her and help her through this journey of healing.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!

This week, though, with the Ray Rice video, I decided to speak out. I wrote a lot of #WhyIStayed and #WhyILeft tweets. I wanted to speak up for all the women who can't, let them know they're not alone, like I once thought I was all alone.

But now I'm feeling so sad. It has been a couple days and I guess reliving it all, even just on Twitter, brought some of it back. I don't even know why I'm complaining. I'm just sad now, that's all.

23dma1,"Looking for some support I originally posted in TwoXChromosomes, but got nothing but accusations and no actual support or discussion. This is my first time on this subreddit, but I'm hoping all of you will be more helpful than TwoX. Since this somehow wasn't clear last time I posted, I'll state right off the bat that I'm not looking for anyone to tell me what I ""need"" to do. I just want some womanly support to help me feel like this is just yet another thing part of my life that will pass even though right now it's hard.

Long story short, the reappearance of past issues is causing not only intimacy issues but also what I would consider backpedaling in many aspects of my life.

More than a decade ago I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a neighbor. I spent many years keeping the event shoved under the carpet, blamed myself, and struggled functioning in everyday activities. After a lot of exploration into support forums, etc. and finally creating healthy relationships, I began to move on and learn to accept who I've become. I by no means ever fully recovered, but I at least grew into a functional, mostly logical woman. The issues I had been coping with were a thing of the past.

Recently though I feel like I've done a complete 180. Nothing in my life has changed in the past few months so I'm at a loss as to what is causing these feelings, and subsequently how to fix this. I feel as if I'm back to where I started with feelings of depression, anxiety, fear of intimacy, an aversion towards physical contact, and little to no appetite.

My significant other (though unaware of exact details) knows that I've had issues in my past but has seemingly forgotten. Many of the things they say are off-handed but very grating and are making me feel less comfortable even bringing up what's bothering me (and quite honestly I don't think they realize much of anything is wrong other than normal, everyday stresses). Also, though our sex life has always been very enjoyable, they don't understand that I don't have any sex drive right now. I feel bad for ""holding out"" (my words, not theirs), but I feel even guiltier after the fact when I know that I've faked my enjoyment.

I'm not looking for advice to open up to my SO. I realize that I could (and probably should) do this, but I'm content letting them be clueless. Ignorance is bliss. What I really want is some sort of support that I'm not crazy, and that things will get better.",abuse,"['looking', 'support', 'originally', 'posted', 'twoxchromosomes', 'got', 'nothing', 'accusations', 'actual', 'support', 'discussion', 'first', 'time', 'subreddit', 'hoping', 'helpful', 'twox', 'since', 'somehow', 'clear', 'last', 'time', 'posted', 'state', 'right', 'bat', 'looking', 'anyone', 'tell', 'need', 'want', 'womanly', 'support', 'help', 'feel', 'like', 'yet', 'another', 'thing', 'part', 'life', 'pass', 'even', 'though', 'right', 'hard', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'reappearance', 'past', 'issues', 'causing', 'intimacy', 'issues', 'also', 'would', 'consider', 'backpedaling', 'many', 'aspects', 'life', 'decade', 'ago', 'repeatedly', 'sexually', 'assaulted', 'neighbor', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'keeping', 'event', 'shoved', 'carpet', 'blamed', 'struggled', 'functioning', 'everyday', 'activities', 'lot', 'exploration', 'support', 'forums', 'etc', 'finally', 'creating', 'healthy', 'relationships', 'began', 'move', 'learn', 'accept', 'become', 'means', 'ever', 'fully', 'recovered', 'least', 'grew', 'functional', 'mostly', 'logical', 'woman', 'issues', 'coping', 'thing', 'past', 'recently', 'though', 'feel', 'like', 'done', 'complete', 'nothing', 'life', 'changed', 'past', 'months', 'loss', 'causing', 'feelings', 'subsequently', 'fix', 'feel', 'back', 'started', 'feelings', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'intimacy', 'aversion', 'towards', 'physical', 'contact', 'little', 'appetite', 'significant', 'though', 'unaware', 'exact', 'details', 'knows', 'issues', 'past', 'seemingly', 'forgotten', 'many', 'things', 'say', 'handed', 'grating', 'making', 'feel', 'less', 'comfortable', 'even', 'bringing', 'bothering', 'quite', 'honestly', 'think', 'realize', 'much', 'anything', 'wrong', 'normal', 'everyday', 'stresses', 'also', 'though', 'sex', 'life', 'always', 'enjoyable', 'understand', 'sex', 'drive', 'right', 'feel', 'bad', 'holding', 'words', 'feel', 'even', 'guiltier', 'fact', 'know', 'faked', 'enjoyment', 'looking', 'advice', 'open', 'realize', 'could', 'probably', 'content', 'letting', 'clueless', 'ignorance', 'bliss', 'really', 'want', 'sort', 'support', 'crazy', 'things', 'get', 'better']"

1gjddc,"Feel like I'm flashing back to childhood anger... I've been having a lot of anger issues over the last 10 years, maybe more, of my life.  It is getting to the point where I'm afraid that I'm going to get into it with someone one day, and get hurt of worse.  I know my wife fears this too.  
  
When I was growing up, I was always a quiet ""loaner"" type kid.  I never stood up for myself, ever, and I regret that to this day.  And I really think that this plays into a lot of my anger issues now that I'm an adult.  It's almost like, when I get into these blind anger states, it's almost like I'm flashing back to my childhood / teenage years and saying ""Fuck this, fuck you, I'm not going to let you push me around anymore.""  My mind fogs over and all I can see or think about are all the times that I've been abused and all I want to do is lash out.  So now when I encounter the ""bully"" type people as adults, I lash out.  I typically start off by verbally berating people, very vulgar in most cases.  If they respond in any way, this typically leads to me wanting to drop everything and just attack that person.
  
Does anyone else feel like this?  Like you're constantly ""reliving"" (so to speak) your childhood, constantly fighting the bullies from your past?  If so, how do you deal with it in a grown up, non-violent fashion?  
  
I'm really open to suggestion here.  I've been to doctors, both in childhood and as an adult, and have taken meds.  I just don't want to do that anymore, I feel like the meds make me less human, like I don't feel things the way I should anymore, and I don't like that feeling.  
  
My wife is usually good at pulling me out of this frame of mind.  She reminds me that even if I were to get into a physical fight with one of these people, it wouldn't solve anything.  She reminds me that people who are that personality type are always going to be that way, they are not going to change regardless of whether I attack them or not.  If anything, that will provoke them even more.  She tells me that the only things that could come from this are more problems, such as physical injury, being arrested, having charges against me, and in turn having court costs, etc.  These types of reminders usually snap me out, but I just really wish it didn't get to that point in the first place.",non_abuse,"['feel', 'like', 'flashing', 'back', 'childhood', 'anger', 'lot', 'anger', 'issues', 'last', 'years', 'maybe', 'life', 'getting', 'point', 'afraid', 'going', 'get', 'someone', 'one', 'day', 'get', 'hurt', 'worse', 'know', 'wife', 'fears', 'growing', 'always', 'quiet', 'loaner', 'type', 'kid', 'never', 'stood', 'ever', 'regret', 'day', 'really', 'think', 'plays', 'lot', 'anger', 'issues', 'adult', 'almost', 'like', 'get', 'blind', 'anger', 'states', 'almost', 'like', 'flashing', 'back', 'childhood', 'teenage', 'years', 'saying', 'fuck', 'fuck', 'going', 'let', 'push', 'around', 'anymore', 'mind', 'fogs', 'see', 'think', 'times', 'abused', 'want', 'lash', 'encounter', 'bully', 'type', 'people', 'adults', 'lash', 'typically', 'start', 'verbally', 'berating', 'people', 'vulgar', 'cases', 'respond', 'way', 'typically', 'leads', 'wanting', 'drop', 'everything', 'attack', 'person', 'anyone', 'else', 'feel', 'like', 'like', 'constantly', 'reliving', 'speak', 'childhood', 'constantly', 'fighting', 'bullies', 'past', 'deal', 'grown', 'non', 'violent', 'fashion', 'really', 'open', 'suggestion', 'doctors', 'childhood', 'adult', 'taken', 'meds', 'want', 'anymore', 'feel', 'like', 'meds', 'make', 'less', 'human', 'like', 'feel', 'things', 'way', 'anymore', 'like', 'feeling', 'wife', 'usually', 'good', 'pulling', 'frame', 'mind', 'reminds', 'even', 'get', 'physical', 'fight', 'one', 'people', 'would', 'solve', 'anything', 'reminds', 'people', 'personality', 'type', 'always', 'going', 'way', 'going', 'change', 'regardless', 'whether', 'attack', 'anything', 'provoke', 'even', 'tells', 'things', 'could', 'come', 'problems', 'physical', 'injury', 'arrested', 'charges', 'turn', 'court', 'costs', 'etc', 'types', 'reminders', 'usually', 'snap', 'really', 'wish', 'get', 'point', 'first', 'place']"

He started drinking and driving home drunk and would hit me, kick me.
Including once when i just had surgery he punched me in the stomach. So i got defensive and hit him in the balls and he hit my in the eye as i fell down and got a black eye. I called the cops. First warning right.. well he said sorry everything kinda got better. Until it happened again one night and his sister and her kids also got hit. He was blacked out. He went to jail for about a month i accepeted him. 
He started to become a real asshole again. Only 2 months in. He broke up with me! But still we were on and off. Got pregnant.
 He did push me to the wall when i was pregnant. 
Gave  birth. And here i am a year later  bruise on my rib, feet, hands, and my face . 
He says it only happens because of my actions and if that i have to change. But i dont understand. I dont hit back. I just cry and cry and ask god to take me before he does. He says he wants me to be by his side when he angry , towards me! He spits nasty words at me and call me names. I dont want to be in that room. He calls me out on my mistake, i understand but he gets so nasty with it. He throws tantrum and throw glasses and door knobs and break my valuables. He always tell me to shut up, and then ask why i dont communicate. We have a one year old daughter who watched us fight as he jumped on top of me on the bed and punched my rib trying to get me to stop crying. Choked me and hit me multiple times. Telling me im not there for him. Its all because i walked away from him ""rude as fuck makes me wanna kill myself lecture"" of my mistake. I can walk away if want to right?
Is it really my fault. Should i just shut up take his lectures. Did i really deserve it. I dont understand. I am a stay at home mother who cleans and cook for him. A few days i forget a few things and all hell runs lose. I dont have family members who can help me 
Out(long story). And i have nowhere to go. I often think about killing myself. But i cant leave my daughter with this angry man. 

Help me.  It is 1:39pm he will be home 10:30pm tonight. 
I want to divorce him. But i am afraid.

xthze,"Victims in Abusive Relationships What is the dominating factor in the victim's choice to stay in the relationship instead of walking away? (given that they know they are in a physically and mentally abusive relationship). Logically if I was to assume then I'd think maybe it is the authority established by the abusive partner (How? I'm thinking maybe somewhere along the lines of compliance conditioning; control by fear; control by depriving self esteem; isolation and conditioning to create dependence; etc... ). This is just my guess though, what does DV think? 

Also, how can this control and authority be broken? has anyone ever tried to rescue an abused victim and succeeded? I'm thinking direct lecture to the victim wont work since that's the first thing everyone does and it never works. Can I guess to start with boosting the esteem of the victim first?

16kh0l,"I'm committed to solving my abusive anger I just found this subreddit and I'm glad it's here.  

When I was a kid it was tantrums, which I occasionally will still throw as a mid-20s woman.  Mostly now it's pure venom at any perceived threat.  Like most of you, I'm pretty calm most of the time.  I don't keep high expectations for life and I can be very easy-going, but when I'm threatened, when I'm anxious, it's so hard to control myself.  And up until recently, I felt justified in spewing my hate at people who I thought deserved it.  My long-term boyfriend gets the most of it, though I have been bad to my immediate family over the years as well.  

But my boyfriend isn't coping well.  I monopolize his time with my emotional outbursts, expecting him to drop everything and make me feel better.  And when he can't I just rage on.  It doesn't solve anything or make anybody feel better and it's pathetic.  He stopped being completely honest with me because he feared my unpredictable rage.  I can't have that.  My reality relies on him telling me the truth.  I can't expect him to take care of me if I don't take care of him, emotionally.

So I've committed to beating this thing.  I'm not going to lose my mind over nothing.  I'm not going to attack attack attack just to release the rage inside.  I can't do it anymore.  The most important person in the world to me is hurting.  This is different than before, where I was of the mindset of ""Well if you don't want me to get angry, don't do things that make me angry.""  This reinforced my outbursts and fed them.  No good.

Here are steps I'm taking:

-Reading whatever anger management material I can get my hands on for free.

If I feel I do need to invest money in this eventually, I want to have a context for what sorts of resources are available in the first place.  I don't think something's better just because it costs more. 

Right now I'm reading Healing the Shame that Binds You, and Dr. Joe's Freed From Anger.  I haven't given up on the idea that reframing the emotions when I'm calm will help me step back when I'm being flooded with them, even though this has never been effective before.  It's also nice knowing that this is a common problem that people have dealt successfully with.

I am researching meditation.  I have ADHD and an undisciplined mind in general, so I don't know how far I can push this with my crappy will, but the goals of mediation: calm, focus, improved problem-solving, empathy, just being a more effective person in general in order to get the things you want out of life, I want that.  So I'm trying.  

I have to say though, what seems to be making some improvement is this Meditation gong app called Mindfulness Bell.  It gongs roughly every hour during the day and I've had it for about 5 now.  When it gongs and I have a moment, I stop and close my eyes and breath deeply and take stock of my body.  Am I hungry?  Anxious?  In pain?  Wired?  So many times I've had outbursts because I didn't notice that I was uncomfortable.  So this has been pretty helpful so far.  

I encourage people who've tried to really stamp out their abusive anger to share their stories and tips because I really, really want to nail this down.

Thanks for reading, and good luck to each and every one of you.

1avx9m,"Question about reporting (long, sorry) I was abused by my stepdad starting when I was about 8 and ending when I was 19. My biological dad (who only had custody of me on vacations) found a journal entry about the abuse when I was about 15 and took me to therapy. I ended up seeing 3-4 different therapists about my abuse.

None of the therapists I saw ever reported my stepdad for child abuse. I went to a Rape Crisis Center a year or so ago and gave them my history and they were mystified as to why it was never reported in any state, no documentation, no investigation. I accepted this for a long time because I was afraid, and always had been, of repercussions for pressing charges or even just reporting.

Long story short (too late), now, at 28, I have been more or less forced to move back in with my mother and stepdad (yep, still married) because of my financial situation. I'm receiving SSDI for my PTSD and anxiety but it's not enough to live on independently. My father and stepmother refuse to let me live with them so my only choices are living on my own and starving, or living with my mother.

Today my stepdad did something mentally/emotionally abusive that triggered me and I became suddenly furious that he was never reported and never punished for what he did. He has had access to children over the years, though I'm not sure he does now, and I have felt awful for never taking action and helping other potential victims.

I emailed the therapy center I first went to and asked why he was never reported. The director emailed back and said he should have been and that she can look into why it wasn't, and suggested I report him now to CPS as he may have access to children.

But now I'm conflicted. Every reason I ever had for not reporting/pressing charges has come back to me: I don't want to take away my mother's badly needed second income, I don't want her to lose her house or have to take a second job (she's in her 60s) and I don't want to be shunned by the whole family who would inevitably find out that I reported it and blame me for burdening my mother.

My current shrink, who has been very good and helpful, says I am just making myself upset and I should forget about it and move on. He says I should let the past stay in the past and preserve harmony in my living situation and I voluntarily moved back in here. I feel like this invalidates my suffering and the potential suffering of others and gives my stepdad a free pass on all the child abuse he committed.

I do not know what to do--whether to pursue the reporting to CPS or to let it go and instead focus on getting financially stable so I can move out again.",abuse,"['question', 'reporting', 'long', 'sorry', 'abused', 'stepdad', 'starting', 'ending', 'biological', 'dad', 'custody', 'vacations', 'found', 'journal', 'entry', 'abuse', 'took', 'therapy', 'ended', 'seeing', 'different', 'therapists', 'abuse', 'none', 'therapists', 'saw', 'ever', 'reported', 'stepdad', 'child', 'abuse', 'went', 'rape', 'crisis', 'center', 'year', 'ago', 'gave', 'history', 'mystified', 'never', 'reported', 'state', 'documentation', 'investigation', 'accepted', 'long', 'time', 'afraid', 'always', 'repercussions', 'pressing', 'charges', 'even', 'reporting', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'late', 'less', 'forced', 'move', 'back', 'mother', 'stepdad', 'yep', 'still', 'married', 'financial', 'situation', 'receiving', 'ssdi', 'ptsd', 'anxiety', 'enough', 'live', 'independently', 'father', 'stepmother', 'refuse', 'let', 'live', 'choices', 'living', 'starving', 'living', 'mother', 'today', 'stepdad', 'something', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'abusive', 'triggered', 'became', 'suddenly', 'furious', 'never', 'reported', 'never', 'punished', 'access', 'children', 'years', 'though', 'sure', 'felt', 'awful', 'never', 'taking', 'action', 'helping', 'potential', 'victims', 'emailed', 'therapy', 'center', 'first', 'went', 'asked', 'never', 'reported', 'director', 'emailed', 'back', 'said', 'look', 'suggested', 'report', 'cps', 'may', 'access', 'children', 'conflicted', 'every', 'reason', 'ever', 'reporting', 'pressing', 'charges', 'come', 'back', 'want', 'take', 'away', 'mother', 'badly', 'needed', 'second', 'income', 'want', 'lose', 'house', 'take', 'second', 'job', 'want', 'shunned', 'whole', 'family', 'would', 'inevitably', 'find', 'reported', 'blame', 'burdening', 'mother', 'current', 'shrink', 'good', 'helpful', 'says', 'making', 'upset', 'forget', 'move', 'says', 'let', 'past', 'stay', 'past', 'preserve', 'harmony', 'living', 'situation', 'voluntarily', 'moved', 'back', 'feel', 'like', 'invalidates', 'suffering', 'potential', 'suffering', 'others', 'gives', 'stepdad', 'free', 'pass', 'child', 'abuse', 'committed', 'know', 'whether', 'pursue', 'reporting', 'cps', 'let', 'go', 'instead', 'focus', 'getting', 'financially', 'stable', 'move']"
1iqob5,"I always want to fight. I don't really know how I should start this, but I'll try my best to make it transition smoothly.

I've been depressed for two years, and extremely suicidal for the past 9 months. I've always been a soft person. Would never hurt a fly(In my own opinion. It might be different to other people). I would consider myself to be a very caring person. But for the past two months, that hasn't been me.

I'm angry at everything. Even if it didn't do anything wrong. The smallest things can set me off. Onions on my burger when I didn't order them? Rage that makes me throw the burger at the wall and scream at the top of my lungs. And all I can think about is fighting. I've been going around town, to different bars and the bad side of town, instigating fights and making other people upset. Even if I know that my ass is going to get whooped by someone, I still try to fight them. I've been knocked out quite a bit because of this, but I still try to go out and fight. 

I don't break things that are valuable to me, but I feel like I'm ruining my relationship with my family due to my constant anger. I don't even have something from my past to be angry about. I'm just always filled with rage.

The only coping skill I have to work in the short term is drugs, which I know is the wrong approach to this. I've used drugs even before I was angry, but my drug use has significantly increased in the past few months. Some drugs make me want to go out and fight people, such as alchohol, DXM, and PCP. I used these select few only on occasion before, but now I'm using them everyday.

1eluw7,"I just sent this to my bf over skype. It wasn't directed at him, but at his ex. I've never even met her, and I really don't care about the relationship they had. For context, I strongly resent my childhood. Honestly, I had a shit life. I know everyone is going to say I shouldn't feel sorry for myself, but I'm in the process of mourning for my inner child. That aside, I've been with my BF for 14 months, I've never met his ex but I hate her. I hate her so much that it leaves me in tears. I am angry at her for being privileged and beautiful. She was able to pursue her passions and had the full support of her super rich parents, while I had my opportunities to do so unfairly taken away from me when I was just a kid. I had a rough fucking childhood. I live in the past, and I mourn the loss of what could have been a beautiful life.

You have so much power and control in my life but you deserve non of it.
You are a worthless piece of shit that doesn't deserve an ounce of respect.
You are a whore, a bastard.
 If I ever saw you on the street, I would fucking gauge your eyes out with my own fucking hands. If I had the opportunity to kill you and get away with it, I would take it in a heartbeat.You don't deserve to live.
I hope you never find love. I hope you spend the rest of your life whoring yourself out to anyone who might make you feel loved. And I hope they fucking rip your heart out.
Because that's what you deserve.
I want to kill you. Destroy you and everything you have.
 You simply don't deserve to live while I'm wasting away. I deserve the life you have.""

2eylap,"My sons become the bully. Recent Past DV. Im so hurt Yesterday he snuck nun chucks to school and hit kids. Today he bit a kids ear. Last week he punched one because they were holding him down. That one I understand.
Five months ago I left his father. I got him in therapy. Therapist aYs he is super well adjusted, teacher is asking if he has a behavioral disorder. I explain to the teacher about how my son has seen a lot of abuse, even if I tried to hide it from him. She didn't think it was just that.
My x drank all the time. Seriously. Had a bottle hidden in our sons room. I couldn't keep up with throwing it out. He lied about driving drunk or drinking at all. When he was drinking he did three things with our son. Played wholesome games, wrestled, and played online and put him infront of video games. He did the last two more than anything.
I spent so many days begging him to stop rough housing, because my son isn't learning good ways to play. Let me reiterate that this isn't just wrestling every now and then. This is hours of the day. But he would call me a dumb bitch and move on to fighting with our son.
So when talking to the teacher this morning I brought that up, and that It was enough that I spent most of the last few months they were together asking him to stop and then giving up and walking away.
The teacher thinks that the wrestling had a much larger impact than seeing me get knocked around ever did. And I am so mad. I can't call my ex and rub it in his face. I feel justified in being right. Bit its just one more thing he will never understand he did. Im sure if i even did try to tell him he would find a way to blame me. Just like some how its my fault for everything else...

29tr89,"Trying to process through all this (word vomit) As stated in my previous post, I'm a 39 yo male survivor of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse.  The abuse was perpetrated by my step-brother, step-father, and because of her complacency, my mother.  

I went through some pretty rough (but effective) therapy in my mid twenties and had a good long run of feeling normal and effective in everyday life.  Because of various life events, i.e. triggers, I've been made to start this journey again.  It's funny, you go along thinking everything's okay and you've put your past behind you, then all of a sudden it slaps you in the face and your realize that EVERYTHING your doing is tinted with the former abuse.  

At my therapists request, I have been trying to think of ways to nurture myself, ways to connect to that injured child inside of me.  This brought me to memories of the abuse by my step brother.  

From the ages of 7 to 10 (ish) my step brother would sexually abuse me at any time it was possible to do so.  He'd make me perform oral on him at first, but soon this moved to anal which was very physically traumatic.  He'd tell me ""take off your pants"" (a phrase that still fills me with dread).  If I didn't he'd start hitting me until i complied.  As I said before, this happened every chance it could.  I was raped by my step brother at the very least every week for years, most times the frequency was more.  It was rough, it hurt, and I was completely fucking powerless.  

Yesterday I cried for that poor kid.  To tell the truth I cried and cried.  How fucked is it to take that choice from someone so young?  How awful was it that I had to survive living in a world where I had no choice.  My biggest worry should have been which LEGO set to buy, or what new Master's of the Universe figure I wanted next, and instead I was forced into this game of cat and mouse trying to avoid my step-brother while putting on a show of normalcy for the rest of the world.  

I tell you what though, that kid survived it.  He may have scars from it, he may have to deal with this shit for the rest of his life, but he was a tough little kid, and I love him for it.  The pain I'm in right now trying to make sense of all this shit that happened, I'm doing it for him just as much as I'm doing it for me.  To make sure he didn't go through all of that in vain.

Background story is that a while ago I started chatting with this older guy online who is pretty sexual. At first I found it kinda hot, but the more I got to know him the more I realized he was into some strange stuff. Eventually he told me that he started dating his previous boyfriend when he (the boyfriend) was 16 and had stayed together for like 6 years. He said the boyfriend's parents knew about it since the beginning and that everything was cool. I let it slide even though in retrospect I probably shouldn't have. Later on he revealed that he and his ex had done some pretty disturbing stuff in bed, and that the ex's parents didn't know about this aspect of their ""relationship"". One day he admitted the ex was actually 15(!) when they met, and that's when I lost it. I told him that I thought he was disgusting and haven't been in contact with him since.

I've been feeling pretty sick about the whole thing. I mean, even though I am of legal age, this is a guy who apparently has not problem getting physical with someone who isn't. Not only that but sexual ""interests"" are plain abusive. I've been having trouble sleeping lately. I feel guilty that I didn't end communication with him sooner and that he's still out there and I haven't done anything about it.

The problem is: what can I do? I have no concrete proof that he did anything the claims to have done even though my gut says he did. The guy who is allegedly his ex is now 21+ so they could just easily deny this. Also, as selfish is this sounds (and trust me, it keeps me up at night) currently I'm going through a security background check for a job, and I'm worried that reporting him might come back and bite me in the ass. 

I know I'm rambling a bit, but I needed to get this off my chest. I would appreciate if someone could tell me what would be a good way to report him as a potential threat.

14a01t,"I'm a woman in my early twenties, I live with my boyfriend and I think I need some help. Sorry this is so long.

I've been living with my boyfriend (also in his early twenties) for only two months, after a period of homelessness, sleeping on friend's couches. He'd been a friend of mine for about a year, having previously dated one of my best friends, and we got together during the time I was looking for a permanent place.

At first everything was okay - aside from his issues with alcohol/depression that is, but I knew that already, and thought (perhaps naively) that I could 'handle' that. I'd confided in him that I was raped by a 'friend' four years ago and as a result suffer from PTSD, for which I am in therapy; he was considerate and sympathetic, and I felt reassured. We're both university students, and thought hey, why not move in together for support? I needed a placed to live, after all.

Almost from the day I moved in he started shouting at me, intimidating me, insulting me, grabbing my hair or my arms when he was angry about something. Within the first week of me living here, he raped me - my worst nightmare, he knew it was, and he told me he did it 'because he could'. 

He's aggressive and his mood swings are unpredictable. I convinced him to go to the doctor - he's had blood tests to check if his alcohol abuse has damaged his liver, and the doctor has referred him to the community mental health team (he admitted what he's been doing to me). He's cut back on drinking, and is getting better at catching himself when he gets frustrated, but he still says things that terrify me, he hurts me and is sexually aggressive. 

I've moved 200 miles from my home town and none of my old friends even know what is happening (I don't even think they'd believe me, he always seemed 'strange', but sweet and friendly back when we were just friends). We have housemates, and the girl next door to us has told me she has heard things, which is humiliating and makes it even harder to cope with living here.

My psychiatrist recommended a talk therapist, so I went for my first session this past Monday. She told me to find a book titled 'Why Does He Do That?' and that what my husband has been doing to me for years is actually considered abuse. I've been reading the book and it's really upsetting.

Brother is 29. Terrible temper.  He hits her, he screams at her, destroys her things. They both live in Hawaii. I'm here in California. She's reached out to me for help but I don't know how to advise her on what to do.  Anyone out there been in this situation and can help?

Some background:
Brother has been dumped a couple times in the past by girls.  In both cases they had lied/cheated on him. He has a ""Girls are stupid"" mentality and has no qualms about hitting someone when he is angry. He's been in jail before for a DUI.  He was kicked out of law school because he harassed a girl while out clubbing. He is out of work, in plenty of school debt, and being sued by the people he crashed into while drunk driving.

He told our family that after his time in jail he decided he would change things around but it has gotten worse.  He terrorizes his girlfriend and her mother and grandmother.  He has spat at her, shoved her, given her cuts and bruises. Been mad at her for not putting out. Throws things, (thrown a computer down the stairs, she nearly fell down the whole way while trying to catch it). 

Just today he threw my mother's engagement ring out the window (my mom gave it to him thinking he would propose to her) and is currently yelling and stomping around the yard trying to find it. His girlfriend actually found it when he wasn't looking and I had her keep it safe to give back to my mom).

I am scared because I have seen his wrath before too. We are both scared.  I've done nothing about it in the past.  I don't want her to keep suffering like this though.  I want to help her family but need some help on what to do. Your thoughts please?

2dg991,"Concerning my abusive ex Hi. First off, I'm sorry if I am posting this in the wrong place. I need to get this off my chest.

I ended things with an abusive partner about 10-11 months ago, cut all contact with him and have been dealing with what happened whilst in therapy. I've had to stop seeing my therapist and I'm trying to get into therapy again but it may take a while to get sorted. 

Basically, there's a course that I am very into and really want to do at a local college and I'll be enrolling there. I really want to take charge of my future but I'm aware that my ex goes to that college and will still be taking a course there.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with anxiety and fear of running into him in this college? I can't stand the idea of seeing him and it makes me very anxious to think about. Although it is a large campus I'm terrified of seeing him after everything that happened. Has anyone gone through a similar experience or know how to try to deal with these feelings?

Again, sorry if I posted this in the wrong place.",abuse,"['concerning', 'abusive', 'ex', 'hi', 'first', 'sorry', 'posting', 'wrong', 'place', 'need', 'get', 'chest', 'ended', 'things', 'abusive', 'partner', 'months', 'ago', 'cut', 'contact', 'dealing', 'happened', 'whilst', 'therapy', 'stop', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'trying', 'get', 'therapy', 'may', 'take', 'get', 'sorted', 'basically', 'course', 'really', 'want', 'local', 'college', 'enrolling', 'really', 'want', 'take', 'charge', 'future', 'aware', 'ex', 'goes', 'college', 'still', 'taking', 'course', 'anyone', 'advice', 'deal', 'anxiety', 'fear', 'running', 'college', 'stand', 'idea', 'seeing', 'makes', 'anxious', 'think', 'although', 'large', 'campus', 'terrified', 'seeing', 'everything', 'happened', 'anyone', 'gone', 'similar', 'experience', 'know', 'try', 'deal', 'feelings', 'sorry', 'posted', 'wrong', 'place']"
33ce8m,"Not sure how to feel These past months have been terrible. I can't seem to get myself together the way I used to. I have never in my life vented out to strangers but you can only hold it in for so long.....14 years is long enough. So here it's goes. I grew up very poor......1st generation. My mother grew up on a opium and marijuana farm. Both my parents have less than high school education. I was born in the U.S. along with my 3 youngest siblings of 6....2 brothers 3 sisters. Growing up I witnessed my older siblings come home drunk and being tied up to a pole and beaten by my father. Along other violent things as well. I've been neglected, abused, and molested. Molested continually since the age 6 to until the age of 10 by my grandfather who just recently passed. My oldest sister was in ""college"" for 6 years when I was 6 (actually in prison) and then was deported. My oldest brothers became addicted to drugs and are currently tearing their lives apart. My mother is currently living with my youngest sister and my violent alcoholic father. She is hoping for a divorce but has no one to help her. I am constantly worrying about them while I, myself is on her second year of college and struggling to even get by. I quit my job because i couldn't keep myself together. School work just keeps stacking and I am not able to keep up the way I used to. I used to be very suicidal and depressed but had always been shunned for being sad by everyone in my family.

1fu0vn,"I was abused and it has resulted in what I think is a personality disorder.. do you agree? Is there hope for me :( I am pretty sure I have both borderline personality disorder and psychopathology. I seem to have all the traits except problems with crime before 13. I had these tendencies before because my father was insane. He was a criminal himself and a psychopath. He was tactless, ruthless, unforgiving, unemotional, and unethical and lacked empathy to the excess. But infront of others, charming, whitty, flawless. Anyways I think I appear the same but I have difficulty controlling my cover. I am always lashing out and not thinking of consequences. The list is endless but just imagin putting a borderline in a room with a psychopath and leaving them in there and bam you have me. It all started when I started dating someone who was a psychopath. I doubt he was borderline but possibly it is hard to say. He has all the characteristics of a psychopath. Anyways I was with him for 5.5 years and I ended it cause of the toxicity and abuse and control. IT has been 3 years now and I can not shake the feelings I have. The seemed to have sorta been budding when I was in the 20s but I was normal and happy and could definitely manage such as holding a job, not getting bord enough to quit. Now I have 0 tolerance for anything. I get bord of a job in 3 months and quit, or get fired for telling the boss of and loosing my cool...

Anyways.. I guess I wonder if it can change since I want it to change. I have not been diagnosed yet. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder but I definitely lied to the psychiatrist. I was scared if i shared some of my true feelings or things I have done I might be sent right to the psych ward or charged.

I'm going to go for another assessment tho with a different doctor and be honest. I have gone to CBT therapy, DBT therapy and more. It is hard for me cause i do want to change but it almost seems like my brain is stuck this way, and from reading about this disorder, looks like I might be right and can only hope to manage the symptoms. I hope that is not true. :(

1xnffa,"Separate abuser from everyone else in my family for my own sanity? Feels like it is impossible when everyone ignores you/the abuse/the situation. What can I do? Extremely abusive sibling. Younger sister, absolutely hates me for no reason. Says that my existence is a problem to her and that I should kill myself for her satisfaction, and if I do not, she will continue to make sure I end up doing so. My misery = her life source.

I moved out, and have strengthened ruined relationships with my parents (ruined because of her). However, even after moving out.. I am extremely depressed. No one really cares about or understands my suffering, parents and brother are indifferent and will only be good to me when I am making their lives better or helping them.

Realized more recently since moving out that I cannot go home unless she isn't there. Depression and anxiety because of her and other parts of my life have left me feeling like a ticking time bomb, and I am supposed to be a lot better now that I have moved out. I still can't deal with normal downs of life, let alone visit home to see my own parents or other family because she will be there.

How do I separate her from what I value and cherish most- my family? My family is dysfunctional and depressed in their own ways and I cannot seek help from them. All I try to do is make their lives better, and it makes me feel better. I want family in my life. I can't disassociate my emotionally abusive sister from my family (parents/extended family).

He was never violent really but there's been a couple of incidents when he's pushed me and sometimes when we argue he gets up in my face and is intimidating. I wouldn't say he's abusive now, but sometimes I see the abusive behaviour come back. I'm just worried about what might happen if we move in together. Mostly I'm just super excited, but at the back of my mind I'm saying ""what if"". I don't know, is an abuser always an abuser?

25yjfr,"Bad day. New member. (Long) I kind of stumbled along this sub randomly looking for things today. I should make a fake profile, but it really doesn't matter. 

I made myself go see the doctor finally. I felt sick the whole way. I've been in bed for months now, and even my kids are beginning to notice that I'm not acting the same. When the doctor came in, everything just started spilling out.

 I signed all the papers for them to have access to my previous medical records, and I had to explain how my childhood records are full of all these crazy diagnosis and different doctors, from my mom dragging me around and teaching me what to say so she could get the drugs she wanted.

I had to explain the drug use, and how my mother taught me to snort the speed pills I was given for ""ADHD"". I explained how it graduated to cocaine, alcohol, pot, pills, sleep meds ect... 

I've only seen doctors for childbirth since I was an adult, so my records are mostly non existent anyway. I don't know what happens with records from foster care. 

I cried when I explained that hugging my kids makes me feel sick, because I hate when people touch me. But, I hug them anyway because I don't want them to be weird like me. I cried when I explained I never had a babysitter until my kids could talk clearly and understandably because I think most people like to hurt kids for fun, or touch them for pleasure. 

I told the doctor all my kids are fathered by my boyfriend. They don't need to know how my firstborn came about. I told her how I sit in the dark all day, until my kids come home when I have to pretend I'm normal, so I don't mess them up. 

When she asked me about sexual abuse I told her about my mom's friends,  but not about my mom. That shit makes everyone uncomfortable. Every one gets skeptical when you tell them about a mom coming into her daughters room at night. 

I've spent the rest of the day in bed with all the lights off. Today took way to much out of me. The doctor says I should try one more time with a psychiatrist and a counseler. She wrote me prozac after asking about suicide a lot. I don't know if I can even bring myself to call the psychiatrist.

1fepjm,"At the time (17/M), was I abused in this relationship, and if so, is it normal for me to feel how I do in this? Some background. I am a 19 year old male, and she is a 19 year old female. At the time i was 17 and she was 16/17. I am not at all a violent person. Even when i was drunk or high (recovering addict here) i wouldn't be violent, I would just be more social and less depressed. I am and have been a pacifist. I just don't believe in violence. If this was an abusive relationship, she was the abuser. She would see my friends behind my back (sexually i mean), flirt with most guys, hit me, harass me for ""being a pushover"", and in one instance, raped me (yes, women can rape men). For context, (i have another reddit account and have made known what has happened for the most part on that one) she would always flirt with guys while we were dating. Online, in person, wherever. She would date my friends behind my back while we were dating. She's punched me in the face multiple times, mostly for being intoxicated. Not intoxicated around her, just for the fact that i was not in a sober state of mind at some point. (ie. after even one beer, or for doing cocaine a few days before i see her). Since i would never do anything back to her for it, I would get called a pussy, pushover, shit like that, especially around my friends. I'm not even gonna get into the rape aspect of things because i honestly don't want to talk about it. long story short, (we were in between relationships at this point) i was drunk and at home and she fucked me without my consent (i was dating another girl at the time because we broke up. we got back together the day after she raped me). As I said. I'm not a violent person at all. I tried to get her off of me and eventually did. i guess it was attempted rape but still. Even when we weren't in a relationship she'd get pissed at me and get physically violent at me sometimes for even talking to another girl. 

anyway, to the main point of things. Even a year after our last relationship, I still have a lot of feelings for her. Like, She's probably the one girl I can say i'm truly still not over. I do truly love her, or at least i think i do. Has anyone else felt like I do after being part of an abusive relationship? was this even an abusive relationship or was it just dysfunctional? Even a year after everything has happened i'm still confused about this and how i feel about her.

Under a week ago her husband attempted to kill her. Luckily she and my siblings are ok, and he's in jail likely to go to prison.

My mother is in a tight financial situation now; without her husband's income there's no way to make ends meet. Specifically they got a loan on a second car less than a month ago. It's in both of their names. She would be held liable for the payments on this car since he lost his job when he was sent to jail.

I would like to know if there are any services available where the loan and car would be removed given the circumstances, or if there's any examples of situations where this was sorted out.",abuse,"['financial', 'advice', 'needed', 'domestic', 'violence', 'victim', 'seeking', 'advice', 'mother', 'personally', 'adult', 'college', 'live', 'different', 'state', 'remarried', 'sister', 'year', 'ago', 'baby', 'brother', 'week', 'ago', 'husband', 'attempted', 'kill', 'luckily', 'siblings', 'ok', 'jail', 'likely', 'go', 'prison', 'mother', 'tight', 'financial', 'situation', 'without', 'husband', 'income', 'way', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'specifically', 'got', 'loan', 'second', 'car', 'less', 'month', 'ago', 'names', 'would', 'held', 'liable', 'payments', 'car', 'since', 'lost', 'job', 'sent', 'jail', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'services', 'available', 'loan', 'car', 'would', 'removed', 'given', 'circumstances', 'examples', 'situations', 'sorted']"
vxsk7,"In the process of divorce from my emotionally abusive ex-husband. Starting group therapy tomorrow. Hi, I'm 21F and I left my 3yr relationship, year-long marriage a month ago. He was 28. He was emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling, though perhaps not to the extent that a lot of women suffer through. I also suffered some sexual abuse, but I've been told that falls in with the emotional aspect of it. 

He coerced me into blowjobs even when my jaw was so bad(tmj) that I cried, then accused me of fake crying to get out of it. Several nights, I'd tell him I wasn't up for sex, then later wake up with him inside me. 

Both of my older siblings were mentally abusive when I was growing up, and that's had a severe effect on my ability to build and maintain healthy relationships.

Anyway, he is stalking me online, so I'm trying to get a protective order. He spreads lies about me and gets his friends to harass me. I'm afraid of sex. I feel sick just thinking about it. So I have decided to seek therapy. 

My first session, tomorrow, is group therapy. I will also see an individual counselor. I'm excited, nervous, and a little frightened. It's still hard for me to admit to having been abused because it wasn't physical. I learned at the women's shelter today that women who were abused as children often don't think twice that they're being abused because it seems normal to them. That's how I felt. 

I just wanted to share my story. There are more details throughout my posting history if anyone wants to read more. I'm not quite here for advice, but want to reach out to anyone who feels trapped. Leaving your abuser is the hardest thing you'll ever do, but it's worth it in the long run. So, please, if you need to talk, reach out. :)

2r9sx1,"the bleeding won't stop... It started when I was around the age of 3-7 and once in my mid 20's. 5-6 people all up had abused me.
Sexual abuse by extended family, my half uncle started it. No penetration. 
Then family friends took advantage of me also.

I'm 28/male, struggling to fit in, confidence is down, prefer women, but have dabbled with guys. Thinking about taking my life away. I have no kids of my own, TBH I'm not really interested in having children I think in this lifetime. Not with some of the experienced horrors I've had to go through. 

Tried meditation, semi-worked. Tried psychedelics, left me wondering even more, and an addiction for escapism/peace on that level, which I'm trying to ween myself away from now.

My memory is completely shot, I'm forgetting things all the time. Except for the worst that has happened to me.

I do have a beautiful and supportive family, they know my issues. I want to release this pain I can't fix. Suicide is looking like the only option. Something quick and painless. 

I recently encountered an angel of death, bringing the message that I will be knocked. Unsure as to why. Why waste the money? I will do it myself shortly, possibly....

2pmf39,"I realized what was happening I know he's emotionally abusive from what I've been told by others.  I've read the information and agreed with him being an emotional abuser.  However, things have been going pretty well with the exception of the occasional names he calls me and arguments here and there.  But nothing major, the calm before the storm.
So today I was having a disagreement with someone about appts.  He starts yelling and the person practically runs away.  I was embarrassed and closed the door.  He comes down stairs and starts telling me I'm a push over and never stand up for myself etc.  I said ""perhaps you should have talked to them instead.""  He goes off yelling at me and saying he had to handle it and if I grew a backbone if stand up for myself.  Then saying he was being blamed now for what happened.  
At that moment I had absolute clarity and in the middle of my tears and his belittling me in front of the kids.  I said ""no one blamed you for anything, I never asked for your help and I was handling it as graciously as I could."" He was trying to turn it around and make himself the victim.  How he's sick in bed and trying to help and now I'm yelling at him.  
Then he tried to say I was lying and I have no idea how I was lying when I never asked for help.
I know he messed with my memories of stuff and makes me feel crazy and I can't tell what's real.  But if I had not had that moment of clarity I would've taken the blame and kept crying and he would've piled on insults.  It was like a slap in the face for him and he walked off into another room because I stood up for myself.

When I'm in a good mood, I don't mind the fact that half of my son's genes came from his father.

But when I look back on the abuse I endured, I feel so much hatred for his father, and atleast a bit of it on my son.

What keeps you from feeling angry?

I have changed now, and I do not feel the same anger on my son.

For one, time heals scars. For two, I deliberately think of something else when I feel the hate coming, and it helps. Still, I am curious about how others handle it.

Now I can't think about anything else but her. At every minute I wonder if she is safe. What should I do?

I'm a 34 year old male that was sexually and physically abused by my older half-brother (mother's side). It wasn't until I was about 30 years old that I remembered the sexual side of the abuse. 

My abuser is, even now a piece of crap. He is still financially dependant on my mother. I try to help him be more independent (before I made sense of what he had done). Now a days I avoid my abuser as much as possible.  

So I've known about what he had done for almost 5 years now. I told my mom and sister what happened. My mom... I don't know if she was too embarrassed or upset but she offered no support and just didn't want to hear it. My sister at least listened which is about the best support I've gotten. 

But these past couple nights all the different attacks, being strangled for spilling glue on the record player, forcing me to perform acts. It's all just been clogging me up mentally. 

So moving around time a bit more. My father passed away in 2005 and he left no will. 2 weeks ago I get a letter regarding a 401K that we didn't know about. There's about $80k in the account. Great news right. Well I tell my mother about it. She tells me I need to split it evenly among my sister and the ass. I tell her that he wasn't even my father's son and he doesn't deserve another hand out that he'll blow on whatever he blows it on. But now my mom is pissed at me and I at her. I'm not changing my mind about how to distribute the money. If he wants his share he'll have to take me to court. But after all this I can't stand seeing my mother or walking into the house where a lot of it happened.

Me and my newly ex boyfriend got into a small argument which resulted in him being a complete asshole to me, which is no excuse for my out of control behavior. While I was in tears for reasons he had no idea about, he choses to make jokes and asshole comments. I wanted him to support me emotionally or at least care to ask me what's wrong, since he claims he loved me years before we even dated (friends for 6 years) Half of the time I want to discuss an issue in our relationship he ignores me or make jokes.I'm really insecure about how the the problems I point out are taken with men. I always feel like I'm being laughed at, called naggy, or bitchy for expressing my opinions or emotions. He does nothing to prove me otherwise.

Here's where the abuse kicks in, whenever this happens and he turns cold towards me, I often punch him in the chest. Not knock out punches that i put my strength into, just light ones where I want to push him. He told me its fine when he frustrates me as long as I don't hit his face a while back. But I ended up slapping him after another of his asshole comments. I never did a hard slap that would hurt him. It was done with my fingers, not my palm. But a slap is still a slap and unacceptable. I wanted to bring his face towards mine to try and make him take me seriously and I accidentally scratched his neck. I honestly had no idea it happened. I also tend to throw stuff.

He's broken up with me giving me different reasons everytime until he finally told me that I abuse him. The love he felt for me is gone he says. I know i know i deserve it.I begged him all night to not leave me. I forgave everything he's done to me and I felt like I deserved a second chance. He feels as if my abusiveness will get worse.

I have been in a relationship for 7 years. It has been bad all 7 years. Not only would he cheat on me, but he would beat on me as well. Im finally to the breaking point, to the ignoring him and trying to move on with my life. I have a chance to move to Georgia, to get away, I feel he will worm his way back in my life if I stay, and I will let him. I dont have a great reason why I would let him, except thats what we do. That's been the routine, and I just cant do it anymore. I have 4 children we have 2 together. They've witnessed the violence. I want to get away, I want to just start over new somewhere. Theres still a part of me that would feel horrible if I took the children away from him. I also have a decent paying job (I have an awesome job for being a nobody), I have a financed vehicle (that's on its last leg and probably about to be repoed), and Christmas is coming up. I just need some advice. I wish I could understand why I feel bad. Why does he get to me? It hurts, he will never change, and I really dont want to do it anymore. I cant do it anymore. My family hurts, my children hurt. Do I just say screw it, grab everything and run?  Really alone and really overwhelmed.",abuse,"['outside', 'advice', 'needed', 'please', 'post', 'probably', 'full', 'grammatical', 'errors', 'relationship', 'years', 'bad', 'years', 'would', 'cheat', 'would', 'beat', 'well', 'im', 'finally', 'breaking', 'point', 'ignoring', 'trying', 'move', 'life', 'chance', 'move', 'georgia', 'get', 'away', 'feel', 'worm', 'way', 'back', 'life', 'stay', 'let', 'dont', 'great', 'reason', 'would', 'let', 'except', 'thats', 'routine', 'cant', 'anymore', 'children', 'together', 'witnessed', 'violence', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'want', 'start', 'new', 'somewhere', 'theres', 'still', 'part', 'would', 'feel', 'horrible', 'took', 'children', 'away', 'also', 'decent', 'paying', 'job', 'awesome', 'job', 'nobody', 'financed', 'vehicle', 'last', 'leg', 'probably', 'repoed', 'christmas', 'coming', 'need', 'advice', 'wish', 'could', 'understand', 'feel', 'bad', 'get', 'hurts', 'never', 'change', 'really', 'dont', 'want', 'anymore', 'cant', 'anymore', 'family', 'hurts', 'children', 'hurt', 'say', 'screw', 'grab', 'everything', 'run', 'really', 'alone', 'really', 'overwhelmed']"
192um6,"Recently out of a physically and emotionally abusive relationship. Would appreciate some support. I am a 19 year old guy who had been going out with an 18 year old girl for just under a year. I was emotionally and physically abused by her and it would mean a lot if anybody could offer me some guidance/advice/support.

The abuse began as emotional, which then escalated quickly to physical, forcing me to gain some self-respect and leave.

Examples of her behavior include:

Becoming angry if I introduced her to people as 'this is *insert her name here*' instead of 'this is my girlfriend'.

Demanding I tell her **every** detail of my sexual history, followed by constant judgement and reminders of any part of my past that she deemed disgusting.

Becoming angry if I wanted alone time or wanted to hang out with friends instead of her.

If I was on a trip/holiday/tour which didn't involve her, she would demand I not hang out with friends/colleagues in the evenings and skype her instead. Every night.

Threatening to try and fuck a friend of mine a couple of times, who she had a brief history with, because I annoyed her.

Demanding I delete female friends off facebook.

Becoming angry if I didn't tell that if I had spoken to another girl that day.

Telling me the opposite of what she wants or is feeling and expecting me to know what she truly wants or means, and then becoming annoyed if I didn't.

5 separate accounts of physical violence (punching/slapping/pushing) towards me at times when I annoyed her, 2 of which involved repeated hits to the face and chest.

I never retaliated, and I also think that I should mention that towards the end of our relationship she discovered that her mother had cancer resulting in her becoming depressed.

The event that caused me to leave happened one night at her flat about a month ago. We were having a discussion about maybe finding some professional help for her, she was against it and decided that I was trying to force her to do things she didn't want to. 

She told me to leave, so I stood up and left her room. As I was walking towards the front door, she came storming out of her room and said 'Don't you fucking leave me', as she ran towards me and began to drag me by my jumper back into her room.

Once in her room, she pushed me onto her desk and began to scream in my face. I tried to stay calm and told her to let go off me as I would like to leave. She then said 'How would you like it if I constantly annoyed you?', before she began to repeatedly punch me in the chest.

It was then that I pushed her away and told her that it was over. She began to cry and apologise and beg me not to go before she sat at her door and wouldn't let me leave.

Eventually I got her to move, and I left.

Since breaking up, we have had a few conversations but I have ceased all contact now. Recently, she has got a mutual friend of ours to upload a picture of her kissing other men to facebook as she couldn't do it herself as I have blocked her, told everyone that I'm the bad guy, and generally just been very nasty.

I have not retaliated to any of those things and I did not respond when I received an email yesterday from her telling me she is seeing someone else.

I'm glad that she is no longer part of my life, but now I don't sleep well, have had a constant knot in my stomach for a month, and I can't shake a sense of shame.

I'm sorry for the length of this post, but it has helped me to get it all out.

TL;DR Physically and emotionally abusive ex-girlfriend, would appreciated any words of support or guidance.

Any comments would be welcome.

Thank you.

1vgom7,"An extended family friend of mine recently suffered from an attack. I don't know what to do. This happened in Taiwan (ROC). I'm a Taiwanese American born in Taiwan but I spend most of my time in the States. While I'm back for vacation this month, I heard something very disturbing happened to a girl I know. She is 15 years old, and an extended friend of the family. I've known her since she was a baby. (We know each other but aren't close enough to have direct contact with them.) 

This girl, let's call her C, has two older sisters, A and B respectively. A and B read C's private text messages to a guy (age 18 or so), which consist a reminder for him to bring condoms and something along the lines of ""I get so wet when I think about you."" A and B, outraged, showed it to their father. In a fit of rage, the father started beating C until she was injured so badly she had to be rushed to the hospital emergency room. The medical staff contacted child protective services in Taiwan and they started an investigation. The mother of the family is away oversea on a long-term basis because of work.

A and B, now realized they fucked up, don't know what to do. I have no idea about what the father thinks. I don't even know if the mother knows about this.

I understand there is an investigation going on, but I'm still outraged and really want to do something to help C. Being punished with violence because an adolescent woman had discovered the joys of sex and her sister are rewarded for being ""good vigilantes""? I can't sit by and stomach this. Taiwanese/Chinese women are so oppressed because traditionally, if you enjoy sex then you must be a slut. I'm very worried that the investigation won't go any where because it's likely that the patriarchal society isn't even going to see what F did was wrong and the case would be brush off easily.

I am really tempted to organize some kind of Change.org petition thing to put pressure for father to be prosecuted, because that's the only way I'm aware of that I can help with, but I don't know the victim well enough at all, let alone speak with her about such traumatic event that just happened recently. I'm unfamiliar with Taiwanese laws, and I don't even know if a petition is a good idea for in this particular country/society/culture. I heard about all this from my family. I'm leaving the country and coming back to the States in a few days. No one seems to be doing anything about this and I don't know what can I do to help.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.
